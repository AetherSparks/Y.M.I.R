TRAAAAK128F9318786,Adelitas Way,Scream,"Light the gasoline
I've got the rememdy
To burn your memories
I don't know if it can
Never be afraid
To live with the lies and pain

You're never going to be the same

I don't know if you can

I want to take it too far

Come on don't be shy

I want to make you go down down



(Chorus)

I can make you scream

How I live my life when I have no choice

I see it in your eyes you're crazy

Just scream

How it feels inside

Let me hear your voice

And make it loud this time it opens up my mind



Tell me what you see

I'm not your enemy

If that's what you want to be

I don't know if I can

When you scream my name

And I take all the blame

It's never going to be the same

I don't know if you care

I want to take it too far come on don't be shy

I want to make you go down down



(Chorus)



When you scream

Maybe you're in denial

t kills me I can see it it's on your face

I can't see

Now we're breaking the silence

When you scream

Let it go and you take it away



(Chorus)



Maybe you're in denial

I can make you scream

I can see it it's on your face

When you scream

Now we're breaking the silence

I can make you scream

Let it go and ou take it away

TRAAAAV128F421A322,Western Addiction,A Poor Recipe For Civic Cohesion,"If patience is virtuous
I got the temperament for temperance
Partitioning stems and seeds
Damn lifeless galleries

I'll implement the elements

You're rolling a sacrament

Slicing sharks and your porcelain pedestals

Somehow it seems so pitiful



Catastrophe

Of the highest order

Was likeness captured?

Feigned composure

A poor recipe for civic cohesion



We'll readily collaborate

Understand and participate

Pieces de resistance



Devastated crops of worth

Someone grant me social graces

Being that I'm socially graceless

Billowed soot have we met

Chromatic leaf, this is icy bayonet



I've been commissioned

To ignore companionship

Fashioning barricades

Amid flesh and wilderness



I'm wedlocked to these rivers and tides

These arrangements are my passionate wives

I'd pass you up for seductive seasons

A poor recipe for civic cohesion



Catastrophe

Feigned composure",sadness
TRAAAAW128F429D538,Casual,I Didn't Mean To,"[Verse One:]
Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back

My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me

I react like a mack do I act cool

Just to test her cause I ain't no jester

I suggest her and her friend be outtie

Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy

And doubt me our friendship

But when lips touch

I go crazy in the clutch

Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals

I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do

Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em

Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic

Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about

I didn't mean to



[Chorus: x2]



It ain't my fault that your girl got caught

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)



[Verse Two:]



Another incident when I went

Way beyond what I should of done

John should of stopped before them drawers dropped

But I didn't ain't no quittin

Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin

I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends

But then again I didn't know, sorry

Accept apologies and live on

Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge

Its a new year and I do fear

Ya actions ya actin shy

I mean ya need to be smackin

That hoe

Instead of tryin to front on me ya know

Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know

I run my game on any G ya know

Cause we the most entertainin

I meant to blame women

For makin me do what the Ak seem to

When you call I screen you

I didn't mean to



[Chorus]





[Verse Three:]



Why do fools be schememin dreamin

Actin like demons

Niggas don't give a fuck

Because they beat shit

To many girls front cute

When they want loot

They tell lies the swell guys

Can peep it and thats weak shit

Thats why I run game on every freak I get

Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short

I know the rules on the flooze so who's short

I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo

She tried to get me so I looked at the front door

And now shes not with me so forget it

But every once in a while I'll hit it

And it happened to be your girl

I didn't mean to and I been through

Your relationship and I hate dumb dips

But I really can't trip when they ride my tip

I didn't mean to

The one whose meant for me

You're running on thin air

If you don't really care

From fires that have burned

New ideals and different thoughts

From lessons I have learned

Got the feeling this could take a pretty long while

To find that smile

Put my faith in another piece of good advice

Well I tried that twice

Waiting for, a little something more

Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail

Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit

And made niggas in the Beach love eachother

A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up

Best kept secret so I'm want up

I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7

Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven

Now all I need is a push in the right direction

Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks

Never looking back uh uh, a steady process

And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed

It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man

TRAAAMQ128F1460CD3,Rated R,Keepin It Real (Skit),"You're watching,
When ""Keeping it Real""
Goes Wrong.
Vernon Franklin was
an exceptional young man.
He was the valedictorian
of his high school class,
won several scholarships,
and became the first person
in his family to attend college.
He got a good job and worked
14-hour days, 6 days a week,
quickly becoming
the youngest vice president
in the history
of the Via Corp Corporation,
ending the cycle of violence
and drug addiction
that had plagued
his family for generations.
The officers of his company
were wrapping up the usual
Thursday meeting
in the South Conference Room
when Frank Murphy,
the man who had mentored Vernon,
made an awkward comment.
Vernon, great job, buddy.
You the man.
Give me some skin, huh?
Vernon got along with all
of the people he worked with,
which in his heart of hearts
made him feel like an Uncle Tom.
Though he could have ignored
the simple comment
his mentor made,
Vernon decided to keep it real.
Get your motherfucking hand
out of my face.
You heard me, motherfucker.
Get your hands outta my face.
What you think this is, man?
Just shake my hand like a man.
""All right, give me some five
on the backhand side
with all this crazy jive.""
It's bullshit.
Want a little soft shoe?
Should I juggle some
watermelons for you, boss?
Fuck all that, nigger.
Hey, Vernon, buddy.
Get your motherfucking hands
off me, Frank.
This ain't a game.
This isn't the Vernon I know.
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My name is Hov
You never heard that before,
have you?
Rap music is dangerous.
I used to beat motherfuckers up
just like you just for
walking around my way, nigger.
Vernon, Vernon, buddy.
You better sit the fuck down,
Frank.
Excuse me?
I said sit down, bitch.
Thug life.
You think this
is a game, nigger?
Wu-Tang.
Today, Vernon works
at Sonny's Fill 'Er Up
on Route 80 in New Jersey.
He makes $6.45 an hour
and stinks of gasoline,
even when he's not
at the station.
It's as real as it can be.
Dollar? What I'm gonna
get with a dollar, nigger?
I got kids,
and that's real.
Vernon Franklin, once a heart-
warming story of perseverance.
Wu-Tang.
Today, a sparkling example
of when keeping it real
goes wrong.",neutral

Living within the fear 
 
Hollow lives of misery 
Suck desires & hereditary lies 
A celebration of discontent 
The blind lead the blind 
 
The building of walls protecting the prize 
Imprisoned by a greed 
Paralyzed in a world of regret 
What have you become? 
 
Hollow lives of misery 
Suck desires & hereditary lies 
A celebration of discontent 
The blind lead the blind 
 
Blind lead the blind 
With hereditary lies 
 [4x] 
 
 [Solo] 
 
Hollow lives of misery 
Suck desires & hereditary lies 
A celebration of discontent 
The blind lead the blind 
 
 6. Short Fuse 
Enslaved by fear, its free thoughts demise 
Reason left ignored, replaced by the stench of lies 
Force-fed corruption, swallowed by closed minds 
Selfish greed clouding, thoughts not seen 
 
All is dead, in the land of living hell 
 
Enslaved by fear, its free thoughts demise 
Reason left ignored, replaced by the stench of lies 
Force-fed corruption, swallowed by closed minds 
Selfish greed clouding, thoughts not seen 
 
All is dead, in the land of living hell 
 
Collective mind breeds fear, consumes a hate disease 
A sense of past, empty void overspilling greed 
Making war on those you donât understand 
Tyrant in the name of peace 
 
All is dead, in the land of living hell 
All is dead, in the land of living hell 
 
 7. Chasing Shadows 
Blackened eyes conceal unhealed scars 
The scars of a thousand empty words 
Forgive and forget itâs always the same 
Chasing shadows, time for revenge 
 
Behind false smiles lay broken vows 
And the guilt of conquests dead inside 
Behind false smiles lay broken vows 
And the guilt of conquests dead inside 
 
Standing alone awaiting idols to fall 
Unsettles scores never laid to rest 
Choking on the stench of our deceit 
And living the wreckage of these regrets 
 
Behind false smiles lay broken vows 
And the guilt of conquests dead inside 
Behind false smiles lay broken vows 
And the guilt of conquests dead inside 
 
 [Solo] 
 
Behind false smiles lay broken vows 
And the guilt of conquests dead inside 
Behind false smiles lay broken vows 
And the guilt of conquests dead inside 
 
 8. Human Waste 
The power of church 
And dollars bringing global pain 
 
Cyber genocide and third world country abuse 
Preparing the graves for disposable human waste 
 
The kingdom of the cruel 
The kingdom of your excess 
 
Cyber genocide and third world country abuse 
Preparing the graves for disposable human waste 
 
The power of church 
And dollars bringing global pain 
 
Cyber genocide and third world country abuse 
Preparing the graves for disposable human waste 
 
 9. Rat Hell 
You, you can win the rat race, but still become a rat 
Some will get a head start; some just have to strike back 
 
Some give up, some regret, some fight 
 
If, if youâre one of the unloved, the hated and the hunted 
Donât let them bring you to your knees, stand up and fight 
 
Some give up, some regret, some fight 
 
 [Solo] 
 
Some give up, some regret, some fight 
Some give up, some regret, some fight 
 
Theyâre the true vermin 
Donât let them bring you to your knees 
Theyâre the true vermin 
Donât let them bring you to your knees 
 
 10. Enslaved In Darkness 
This anger burns deep, deep inside 
Born of frustration, contempt & disgust 
 
The nature of your oppression 
Is the aesthetic of our anger 
The nature of your oppression 
Is the aesthetic of our hate 
 
Trapped in an existence you seal your own fate 
You lifeâs an illusion, fuck up wage slaves 
 
The nature of your oppression 
Is the aesthetic of our anger 
The nature of your oppression 
Is the aesthetic of our hate 
 
This anger burns deep, deep inside 
Born of frustration, contempt & disgust 
 
The nature of your oppression 
Is the aesthetic of our anger 
The nature of your oppression 
Is the aesthetic of our hate 
 
 11. Nothing No More 
Like a rope around my neck 
Hanging on every word 
On my knees I chose to crawl 
Bleeding myself dry 
 
Tasting tears of pain 
As skies begin to fall 
Blind inside canât find a way 
Lost and incomplete 
 
Youâre nothing no more 
Fallen from your grace 
Youâre nothing no more 
Fallen from your grace 
 
Sedated on sweet lies 
Naked and confused 
How long should we tolerate, the destruction of our souls? 
 
Youâre nothing no more 
Fallen from your grace 
Youâre nothing no more 
Fallen from your grace 
 
 12. Parasites 
Blindly hedonistic 
With no thought of consequence 
Like parasites we feed 
A carnival of desires 
 
Self obsessed with consumption 
Feeding your corporate lies 
Ravaging all resources 
This world of genocide 
 
A universe of discourse destroying what we create 
A reckless arrogance, weâre living on borrowed time 
 
Self obsessed with consumption 
Feeding your corporate lies 
Ravaging all resources 
This world of genocide 
 
 [?] 
 
Self obsessed with consumption 
Feeding your corporate lies 
Ravaging all resources 
This world of genocide 
 
 13. Revenge 
Life in extremis (Standing at the edge) 
Raging discontent (Canât control these thoughts) 
You now stand accused (Pushed once too far) 
Save your last breath (I damn your love) 
 
Yeahâ¦ fuck all the shit that remains 
 
Razor sharp words (Blunted by swollen fists) 
Beauty turned ugly (Leaving a sour taste) 
Canât hear a word (Of the filth you spew) 
Reduced to nothing (In the wake of my revenge) 
 
Yeahâ¦ fuck all the shit that remains 
 
No moreâ¦ of thisâ¦ madnessâ¦ fuck you 
No moreâ¦ of thisâ¦ madnessâ¦ fuck you 
 
Yeahâ¦ fuck all the shit that remains 
Fuck all the shit that remains 
 
 14. Rotten To The Core 
Lost in dreams fed on corporate greed 
Consuming blindly more than we need 
 
Cruel and uncaring dead inside 
Slaves in a fucking soulless life 
 
A shallow existence for the socially inept 
Self obsessed culture rotten to the core 
 
Cruel and uncaring dead inside 
Slaves in a fucking soulless life 
 
 [Solo] 
 
Lost in dreams fed on corporate greed 
Consuming blindly more than we need 
 
Cruel and uncaring dead inside 
Slaves in a fucking soulless life 
 
 15. Low Life 
Raped by your rules 
Youâre the lowest of life 
Exploited and conned 
Deceived by your lies 
 
Tomorrow, tomorrow, regrets will be no longer 
You fucker, you fucker, my sadness turned to hate 
 
 16. Against The Grain 
Always despised now thereâs no turning back 
From school into society were stabbed in the back 
 
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane 
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane 
 
Canât condition me always too strong for you 
Itâs the law of retaliation fight back, fuck you 
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane 
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane 
 
 17. Screaming Fucking Mayhem 
Life in a bottle is the life for me 
Laying in a hospital bed screaming with DT s 
 
Valium and cider have fucked up me 
But a sober life Iâll never lead 
 
Aargh, Aargh, Aargh, Aargh 
Aargh, Aargh, Aaarrrggghhh! 
 
 18. Death Message 
You! You and your fucking system 
Based on fucking lies and indoctrination 
For your own selfish gains 
 
You! You who live in luxury and hunt down the underprivileged 
By trying to ensure we canât be happy unless we follow your rules 
You! You who try and enforce your fuck-up up self-opinionated rules, of do as youâre told or live a life of misery 
Expecting us to work for fuck all, all to fund your extravagant all consuming lifestyles 
Creating culture of knife and gun wielding backward, lowlife kids, patrolling our streets 
You fucking scum, it has gone too far 
 
You! And your society of greed that youâve created will, will always pick on the ones who never get a fair chance of a start in life, and anyone you find as easy meat 
You! And your fucking shit system spending all our nationsâ resources on war and forcing us all into a life of crime and suicides 
Let all those deaths be on your conscience 
Fuck you all and see you in hell 
 
Iâll live and die by my rules, not yours 
Not fucking yours!!! 
 
 19. Divided & Ruled 
Thoughts controlled from birth a life on your knees 
Oblivion of the mind within their normality 
 
Restricted, confined, mentally chained 
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm 
Restricted, confined, mentally chained 
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm 
 
Rotting in blind dreams content in despair 
A cycle of deprivation is all you deserve 
 
Restricted, confined, mentally chained 
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm 
Restricted, confined, mentally chained 
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm

TRAABHB12903CAFC2F,Bauhaus,A God In An Alcove (Session Version),"Go and look for the dejected once proud
Idol remembered in stone aloud
Then on coins his face was mirrored
Take a look it soon hath slithered
To a fractured marble slab, renunciation clad
His nourishment extract from his subjects

That mass production profile



He's a God- in- in an alcove



Once he spread the rain

So they dreamt in vain

Once he spread the wheat

Had made garlands for his feet

Until the lily poet of our times

Horizoned on the line

Love became the in theme then

Opposing fakers thrice by ten

Don't perceive his empty plea

That redundant effigy



He's a God- in- in an alcove



Take in view his empty stool

What's left is satin cool

Clawing adornment for his crimes

They saw they had to draw the line

So they sent him far away

So they sent him far away

To a little alcove

To a little alcove

All alone



He's a God, a God



Now I am silly

Now I am silly

Silly, silly, silly, silly

Silly",sadness

TRAABIG128F9356C56,Poe,Walk the Walk,"( aka : Beat of my own drum )
Mother spent ten years sitting by a window 
Scared if she spoke she would die of a heart attack 
She listened as her dreams silently screamed 
They drowned like little dolphins caught in a fishnet 



Dear world I'm pleased to meet you 



Hey everybody when you walk the walk 

You gotta back it all up can you talk the talk? 

Hey everybody when I hear the knock 

Don't wanna measure out my life to the tick of a clock 



Hey everybody when my daddy died 

He had a sad sad story living in his eyes 

Hey everybody when you walk the walk 

You can not measure out your life to the tick of a clock 



I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum 

Walk to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum 



Hey everybody 

When you walk the walk 

You gotta back it all up 

Can you talk the talk? 



Hey everybody 

When I hear the knock 

You wanna measure out my life 

To the tick of a clock 

Hey every-, hey everybody 

Can you walk the walk? 



I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 

Walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 



Walk to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna live to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna laugh to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna hang ten, hi, say pleased to meet you 



Take to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna give to the beat of my own drum 

Fly, cry, win, lose, live, die, take five 

Pleased to meet you 



My daddy spent ten years living on the outside looking in 

He thought that he would never get back, hey, get back 

Watched his dream walk across a silver screen 

And he was standing there when the theater went pitch black 



Dear world I'm pleased to meet you 



Hey everybody when I walk the walk 

I gotta back it all up can I talk the talk? 

Hey everybody when I hear the knock 

Don't wanna measure out my life to the tick of a clock 



Hey every-, 

Hey every-, 

Hey every-, 

Hey everybody 

Can you walk the walk? 



Walk, walk, walk 

Can you walk the walk? 



I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 

Walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

(Say wha-wha-what you wanna?) 



Hey, 

Play to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna sing to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna play to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna hang ten, hi, say pleased to meet you 

Screw up to the beat of my own drum 

I wanna dig it out of dirt and do it to my drum 

Scream shout 

Wipe out 

Win, lose, wipe out 

Saunter down my street 

Make love to my baby 

To my baby 

Make love to my baby 

To my baby, oh 



Father : 

It's a wonderful idea, but it doesn't work. 



My own drum, my own beat 

My own drum, my own beat 



Did you ever get the feeling that it's really a joke 

You think you've got it figured out and then you find that you don't 

So you say goodbye to the world and now you're floating in space 

You got no sense of nothing not even a time or a place 

Suddenly you hear it is the beat of your heart 

And for the first time in your life you know your life is about to start 

Oh, yeah, when you're alone 



Hey everybody 

Hey everybody 

Hey everybody when you walk the walk 

You gotta back it up, back it up, back it up, back it what? 

Say wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what you wanna? 

Say wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what you wanna? 





I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

Hey everybody, hey everybody 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums 

Hey everybody, hey everybody 

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums

And what cannot will be done, for every living thing under the sun

Forget color, forget race, and just be one big happy face

Sexual frustration passed down from another age

Their language land and culture, their ancient pride was lost,

And sexual repression was what religion cost.

I'm the road to nowhere, heading west

The sky is purple streaks

The sun is setting in my chest

I feel warm inside

So I'm going for a ride

Put your picture on my dashboard 'till my fate and yours collides



[Mia Doi Todd:]

Seaweed... washed upon the shore...

Severed locks of he who walks the ocean's floor



[Saul Williams:]

Got a yellow Volvo

'86 submarine

Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels and my tank is filled with dreams

Fuck the game, I practice being in the passing lane

And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame

I'm immortal

I render unto Caesar to be cordial

He sees a wooden casket where I see a glowing portal

Check your engine, looks like you're running on the blood of Indians

Put some turquoise in that Rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum

Seaweed... washed upon the shore...

Severed locks of he who walks the ocean's floor

I drive a yellow Volvo

'86 submarine

I drove it under water guided by my own high beams

Nothing's left

Witnessed the demolition of the west

Felt like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress

I'm in space

The lone ambassador of every race

The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face

I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem

A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting ""Om""

I can't believe it

I never really thought that sharks would need it

I thought they'd made their peace: bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it

But I was wrong

Every living being deserves a song

Strangers to each other, but well-known to our big brother

Be listless, lose your aim; go sell your soul for fame

We've ways to measure success here and it has little to do with character

While some struggle to survive; a fight to stay alive

You're more concerned with celebrities than you are with your own family



It makes me sick - I want no part of it

Bring me back to Earth and start my heart again beating

I resign from the roll, forget everything I know

All the lies they told to me to keep me from screaming



Believe what they report; belittle them for sport

Entertainment for humor's sake, but do NOTHING to enact a change

We watch on the cold screen, decipher what this all means

Removed from our humanity and grasping at traces of sanity



It makes me sick - I want no part of it

Bring me down to Earth and start my heart again beating

I resign from the roll, forget everything I know

All the lies they told to me to keep me from screaming

Maybe together we can get somewhere

Starting from zero got nothing to lose

Maybe we'll make something

Me myself I got nothing to prove



You got a fast car

I got a plan to get us out of here

I been working at the convenience store

Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far

Just 'cross the border and into the city

You and I can both get jobs

And finally see what it means to be living



See my old man's got a problem

He live with the bottle that's the way it is

He says his body's too old for working

His body's too young to look like his

My mama went off and left him

She wanted more from life than he could give

I said somebody's got to take care of him

So I quit school and that's what I did



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

We gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way



So remember when we were driving driving in your car

Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

And I had a feeling that I belonged

I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

We go cruising, entertain ourselves

You still ain't got a job

And I work in a market as a checkout girl

I know things will get better

You'll find work and I'll get promoted

We'll move out of the shelter

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs



So remember when we were driving driving in your car

Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

And I had a feeling that I belonged

I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

I got a job that pays all our bills

You stay out drinking late at the bar

See more of your friends than you do of your kids

I'd always hoped for better

Thought maybe together you and me find it

I got no plans I ain't going nowhere

So take your fast car and keep on driving



So remember when we were driving driving in your car

Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

All bottled up as victims of our child's play 







And when we laugh the walls are muted by our existence 



Should I be a bit more persistent when I was you to stay over?

You are the only one that matters 



And the only one who knows 



Every inch of my perimeter 



From my fingers to my toes 







And I don't know where we'll be tomorrow

For these arms once held malignancy

From every place I go.
Sunday morning, there's no one in church,
But the clergy's chosen man

And he is fine I won't worry about him.

Got the book in his hand.



Oh, there's a bitter east wind, and the fields are swaying,

The crows are round their nests.

I wonder what he's in there saying

To all those souls at rest.

I see the path which lead to the door,

And the clergy's chosen man.

Bushes and briars

You and I,

Where do we stand?



I wonder if he knows I'm here,

Watching the briars grow.

And all these people beneath my shoes,

I wonder if they know.

There was a time when every last one,

Knew a clergy's chosen man.

Where are they now?

Thistles and thorns,

Among the sand.



I can't believe that it's so cold

And there ain't been no snow.

From every place I go.

But the clergy's chosen man

Our little worlds fragile

Oh God can you tell us when its going to start

Maybe its not just down to you

oh god can we win back what we have lost

To who's the lost resort, Oh God



Tumbling towards unclear destinations

Do they wash away the flames the wind and the searing rains

As our powers interchange



Oh God can you tell us when its going to start

Maybe its not just down to you

Oh God can we win back what we have lost

To who's the lost resort, oh God

TRAADXP128F931D860,Manuel De Paula,Monta guardia labriego. Cante de trilla,"okay so you probably recognized the
this chord progression and the way we
were playing it right now
because first is very common you'll find
in many songs but there is one very
famous song by maestro camaron that you
will probably recognize it was something
like this on the on the main part was
[Music]
yeah
all right yeah the famous rosa maria by
camaron all right
so now i think we're ready to start
taking
a little lettra a little dirty i would
say in spanish you know which is like
when you have a singer and it's starting
to sing
okay
so what we're gonna do
the way we're gonna do it is like we're
gonna play on a
and we have to do compass that's what we
call doing compass is like keeping the
rhythm of the tangos all right
um so it's going to be very easy because
ours
maestro gandal over here is gonna it's
gonna be singing the letter the lyrics
okay and at the beginning we stay on a
okay and then we're gonna go down on the
on the adolescent
[Music]
okay and he's gonna repeat again and the
second time we actually can put the
extra colors
now one thing that happens on the
flamenco is like when you have singers
there are so many different ways to to
play for them and and to spice up the
chords and to do variations so
so
don't worry too much we'll go little by
little learning different variations and
even later you make your own
combinations and you will listen also to
flamenco players and they will make
different things so
that one guitar is played one way
doesn't mean that another guitarist that
is doing it different is wrong it's just
different okay and all of them are
really valid so
don't don't panic with all these and
don't think that everybody's going crazy
and everybody's playing it different
it's just
there are so many possibilities
so
let's start with that
we're gonna have some some compass first
and then he's gonna start singing okay
and then you're gonna hear a little by
little because this has a lot to do with
the ear okay that when he's going places
at the beginning it's difficult but with
experience and listening to a lot of
music you're gonna get the feel for it
when it's time to change chords for now
we just stay on a like i told you and
later we just go down the cadence okay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay
so you see what we did i was just
waiting for them to sing the first part
which we could do it in so many
different ways for instance we could
take some breaks okay let's take the
very first part

I always believed that if I ran off to India
Wore sandals and shaved my head


And used Body shop conditioner, and incense like crazy



I could call myself a spirit head



But I only went to India to look on top



I wore sandals cause I'd smoked all my money



And I shaved off all my hair cause I had the fleas



I'd been sleeping all over



And the Body shop conditioner was a present from a friend



And the incense used to hide the smell



Of the drug den that I lay in







And so I ask myself what my motives are



For this lying need to look so free



And if I tell myself real honestly



What more can I admit to, open up a door

He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon











I always believed that if I never missed a Yoga class



Read my horoscope in the dailies



And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian



I could call myself a spirit man



But I was only doing Yoga cause I fancied the teacher



And stars cause it looked good on paper



And I only went to church cause my granny gave me money



When confession was over



And I only knew the Indian cause his brother's a dealer



And bottles had a price on their return



So I could go and play, Oh my my











And so I ask myself what my motives are



For this lying need to look so free



And if I tell myself real honestly



What more can I admit to, open up a door

Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor
And watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Love's a hand-me-down brew

I'll never know a Sunday

In this weekday room



I'm talking to the shadows

Of one o'clock before

And Lord how slow the months ago

When all I do is pour

Black coffee

Since the blues caught my eye

I'm hanging out on the move

My Sunday dreams to dry



Now a man is born to go lovin'

A woman's born to weep and fret

To stay home and tend her oven

And drown her past regrets

In coffee and cigarettes



I'm leavin' on the mornin'

Mournin' all the night

And in between, it's nicotine

And not much heart to fight

Black coffee

Feelin' low as the ground

It's drivin' me crazy

This waitin' for my baby

To maybe come around

To maybe come around

Pour me black coffee

And I'll come around",sadness
TRAAEPG128F429139A,Alabama Thunderpussy,Hunting By Echo,"My time alone was well spent but now seems wasted 
Even thought I had grown old enough to shy away from childish decisions 
Keeping occupied with limited pleasure and hours of sorrow to hide 
I'm burning alive every moment on fire everyday of my life 
[Chorus] 

Tried facing the world one on one 

Yet fairness has always remained unknown 

Letting go 



Changing inside hidden by my expressions on the outside 

Praying that sunrise will brighten the darkness of a once peaceful mind 

Sleepless again drenched in sweat pillows collapse with sheets to shed the fragile wood 

Frame bends beneath my head 



This knife stuck in my side crooked and wide 

The blocking of blood steal bone collide 

Leaving me helpless completely defenseless 

My access denied [x4] 



Who was it that said all wounds will heal 

Guess they were never ill 

Explanations only for some of us 

How close can one come to the doorstep of death? 

Before the bell is rung 

A few already know... already know 



My time alone was well spent but now seems wasted 

Even thought I had grown old enough to shy away from childish decisions 

Keeping occupied with limited pleasure and hours of sorrow to hide 

I'm burning alive every moment on fire everyday of my life",sadness

uh there lived a woman who's now known
as St Barbara St Barbara lived in
Micronesia which I'm not exactly sure
where it is but I have a feeling it's
kind of by
Indonesia
anyways it was a little different back
then cuz St Barbara's dad was a wealthy
landowner like an aristocrat but he was
actually fighting Wars that's sort of
one thing they did a little differently
the rich guys fought Wars anyways
um while he was gone St Barbara became a
Christian and you know being a Christian
back then isn't like being a Christian
right now I I it to more like if you had
facial tattoos you know you're kind of
you're kind of you're kind of uh making
a statement being a Christian 300 years
after
Christ there wasn't even Christian rock
back
then anyways St R's dad came home from
the war and found out his daughter
became a Christian he was pissed and if
you think your dad's been pissed at you
st Barbara's dad was more
pissed and so he ordered her to be
executed and whoever makes the decisions
on those kind of things in Micronesia
back then said let's go a little bit
further cuz you know we can't just
execute her St Mar's dad why don't you
execute your own daughter and he was
like awesome I
will so they rolled her into the Town
Square wherever these things
happen and St Barbara's dad beheaded his
own
daughter but it didn't end up so well
for him either cuz he was walking home
to go have a feast or whatever you do
after an
execution and a bolt of lightning came
from the sky and it struck him
dead St Barbara is now the patron saint
of landmines or more specifically not
stepping on a landmine and This song is
called don't let me
explode and he said what about Los
Angeles
she said we never really made it that
far
west oh we scored so big in
Denver that we thought it might be
best to go hang
around back up in the Upper Midwest
right he said what about New
Orleans she goes you know I don't even
think you understand what that means
right while those hangers on those girls
are lifting up their shirts when the
cameras are coming on hey we've been
trying to stay away from those kind of
scenes that we tell
us cuz Jackie Ona said that a say for
Catholics yet think about what they did
to John F Kennedy and then think about
all of his
security and then try to think about
what they might try to pull on you and
me
yeah s barara I'm calling your name
don't let me blow up we'll hook it all
up I guess there's fields of speed with
there's fields of
grave s B tell let me
explode I can feel the whole scene
starting to gr when you're fooling
around on the Frontage
roads and he asked her hey what happened
to
Shag she had to smile out polite like

But you're so heavenly minded, you're no earthly good

There's hungry hands reaching up here from the ground

Move over and share the high ground where you stood

So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good



The gospel ain't gospel until it is spread

But how can you share it where you've got your head

There's hands that reach out for a hand if you would

So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good

When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face
with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father—he told me,
""Son, don't let it slip away""

He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
""When you get older
Your wild life will live
for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid.""
He said, ""One day you'll
leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember.""

I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds
start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve their name into
those shinning stars
He said, ""Go adventure far
beyond these shores.
Don't forsake this life of yours.
I'll guide you home
no matter where you are.""

And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers
Like you
My Mallory heart is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real

Like you



The sound of metal I want to be you

I could learn to be a man

Like you



Plug me in and turn me on

Oh everything is moving



I need my treatment it's tomorrow they send me

Singing ""I am an American""

Do you?



Picture this if they could make the change

I'd love to pull the wires from the wall

Did you?



And who are you and how can I try?

Here inside I like metal

Don't you?

Every heart that's out there breaking, is like a ghost inside of me

Every friend I am deserting, and every danger I am flirting

Every word that ends up hurting, is like a ghost inside of me

Every heart I could be cheering, and every love that I am fearing

Every cry I am hearing, is like a ghost inside of me



Look around, around, look around

Every time I turn around

Down, down, it gets me down

the thousand dreams i dreamed
the splendid things i planned
i always built to last on
weekend shift in sand i live by night
and shine
the naked light of day
and only now i see how the years have
run away yesterday

many songs that waited to be sung
so many wild pleasures that lay in store
for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused

ran out

quickly quickly died the friends i made
all seem
somehow to drift away

Cause I DON'T CARE

If you or me is wrong or right

Ain't gonna spend another night,

In your bed...



Laws of man, are just pretend

They ain't mine



Love so good, love so bad

It won't die



Some talk too long, they know it all

I just smile & move on



Words ain't free, like you & me

I d'ont mind...



Why'd you have to be so mean & cruel,

The dogs are loose i'm on to you

You ball & ...

Chained together from the dawn to dusk,

Can't call it leavin, cause it's just

Tell me
How do you feel when you see me
And I disregard you

There's someone new

And they're true

I can't believe I was so blind I didn't see

That you couldn't be the type of man to meet my needs

Strangest thing is everyone tried to tell me

But I did what they told me not to



You nearly had my everything

by running game on me

You told me all I had to hear

I thought love was finally here

But then one day the truth I'd see your game was incomplete

Cos when I realised the truth

I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof

(I don't want you)



What made you think I would be fooled (Be fooled)

And you're the fool

Tell me (Tell me)

And I disregard you (Disregard you)

There's someone new

And they're true



It was the saddest thing I thought there was no help for me

Cos you made me think I wasn't worth anything

Now I see you didn't have no self esteem

And all you loved was Mel B's money



You nearly had my everything

by running game on me

You told me all I had to hear

I thought love was finally here

But then one day the truth I'd see your game was incomplete

Cos when I realised the truth

I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof

Tell me

How do you feel when you see me (When you see me)

And I disregard you (Oh...)

There's someone new

and they're so true



You nearly had my everything, by running game on me

You lied to me, why did you lie to me

But then one day the truth it seems your game was incomplete

I found out the truth

I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof

(I don't want you)



What made you think I would be fooled

I now see through you (I'm glad I saw through you)

And you're the fool

How do you feel when you see me (Do when you see)

Are wonderin' how the stupidest kid up in the class made it
Sick landscapin' and jammin' down in my mans basement
Getting restraints and complaints from mad neighbors

Now prejudice bigots say I sound just like them damn #@#

The only ounce of power that I have 

Is what I do with now

And how I let the hours pass

I dont' know how long I'm gonna last

So I can't let ya snatch the powder out my hourglass



Everyday that I'm awake I face the angel of death

He may be taken my breath, so they can lay me to rest

And by now my inner state's the only place that I rep

The way that I dress is just another way to express

We know that some day everybody we see will be dead and rotten

Long forgotten, we oughta keep this for a normal topic

Because we all get caught up in all the drama

But what's the gossip gonna mean, when me and you are goners

See I never did audition for a part in this play

I know that some day I'll accidentally fall in my grave

So I can really give a shit about what all of ya say

According to me is how I'm spending all of my days



(Chorus)



The world will keep turnin', the inferno will keep burnin'

But it's affirmative my life on Earth is impermanent

And since I'm visiting and my minutes here are limited

I ain't havin' or doin' shit if I ain't feelin' it

I'll lend a hand to a hurt pedestrian and I will help a friend

In any way that I can, but I can't let man get up in the way of my plans

Make me stray from my path, I can't be takin' that chance

If I combat those fears then how could be in sense to be just tired of this 
get rid of it 
Have I failed you 
Just tell me 

I won't turn away 



If my envy were something special to choose my own failure I waste I waste 

the time to say 

Cause if I combat those places then how is it blamed even if not to be we 

go out the same 

If I'm compelled to infamy what do you see weary I'm tired of this identity 



What pathway 

Is my choice 

Decides 



If this selfishness were something special I choose my own failure I'd waste 

I'd waste the time to be 

Is this something that I spite push deep down inside 



So I'm guilty 

Do you see me 

Can you reach me 

Can you cleanse that's inside 



To see this fate to just let go to break the point to break 

It so I'll take this weight and so then how I'll breath 

One word forgiveness from a TRUSTED CROWN 

His will is in me now 

How do you see me now 

Do you still think I'm proud 

With a virtue instilled somehow 

Presents such loss in DEVINE 

...and so 

AWAKE 



Even though I feel I'm down I'm low I wont let them 

Take my strength that flows even though they say I 

Should be ashamed I cant be the one who pulls against it 

Cause I know I see him he shapes me

since we talk so let me bring it back I
was 16 still in high school on the day
that we first met I knew that we be
friends when I first held you in my head
and pretty soon I sit with you inside my
room and we forget tested school and
homies too and every problem that we had
you made me cool and all my dudes were
jealous of the love we had you needed me
I needed you I felt like you were heaven
sent this is
goodbye we can't do this [ __ ] no more we
had some good
times but I'm not who I was before soon
enough we'd hang out every weekend
dealing with my stress say good night
and place you right there on my table
where I slept I wake up You' be there
for me right when I got out of bed I
think that's why you meant so much to me
because you never left and pretty quick
you made me sick I take a siip you'd
hurt my head when I would drink you make
me think about all the things that I
regret from beard to Rum to whiskey
shots to anything that I could get you
used to give me life but it was clear
that you wanted be dead this is
goodbye we can't do this [ __ ] no more we
had some good time but I'm not who I was
before lately I've been looking back it
all the time we spent didn't know that
hanging out with you is making me forget
I admit that I've been lonely since you
chose to pack your banks sometimes I
want to call but you know I can't take
you back and I can't lie I never cry
this many times over in next it blows my
mind how hard I tried to make you treat
me with respect when things were right
then it was nice but when we fight my
place got wrecked look in my eyes and
Say Goodbye it's awful but it's for the
best avoid
you see every time I go
out I ignore
you but I really have to tell you
now this is good

E' la sera di un giorno da dimenticare 

onde così grandi che non le vedi neanche in mezzo al mare; 

siamo isole di sabbia in mezzo la corrente 

vediamo scorrere la vita, ma non possiamo farci niente. 

Il buio cancella l'orizzonte 

tra il giorno e la notte, un ponte. 

Gli uccelli a quest'ora riposano tra i rami; 

ho bisogno di sentirti dire che mi ami. 



Uh...cosa fai, cosa fai, cosa fai, cosa fai stasera, 

Uh...dove vai, dove vai, dove vai, dove vai esci insieme a me. 



E' la sera di un giorno da dimenticare insieme a te. 



E' la notte di una sera che voglio ricordare; 

come ti muovevi bene, con che gioia lo sai fare. 

Il segreto è l'anima, metterci passione, 

ravvivare questa fiamma 

è la tua missione. 

L'alba disegna l'orizzonte, 

tra l'odio e l'amore un ponte. 

Gli uccelli a quest'ora si staccano dai rami, 

prima che io vada dimmi ancora che mi ami. 



Uh...cosa fai, cosa fai, cosa fai, cosa fai stasera, 

Uh...dove vai, dove vai, dove vai, dove vai esci insieme a me. 



E' la notte di una sera da ricordare grazie a te,

Entering through the door
Ruby glistening from her navel
Shimmering around the floor



Bells on feet go ting-a ling-a linging

Going through my head

Sweat is falling just-a like-a tear drops

Running from her head



Now she's dancing, going through the movements

Swaying to and fro

Body moving, bringing back a memory

Thoughts of long ago



Blood is rushing, temperature is rising

Sweating from my brow

Like a snake, her body fascinates me

I can't look away now



Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Give me time to breathe

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Or I'll have to leave



Now she's moving all around the tables

Luring all in sight

But I know that she cannot see me

Hidden by the light



Closer, closer, she is getting nearer

Soon she'll be in reach

As I enter into a spotlight

She stands lost for speech



Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Give me time to breathe

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Or I'll have to leave

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Give me time to breathe

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Or I'll have to leave



Now I hold her, people are staring

Don't know what to think

And we struggle knocking over tables

Spilling all the drinks



Can't they understand that I want her

Happens every week

Heavy hand upon my collar

Throws me in the street



Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Give me time to breathe

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing

Sit me down

I get accused

Don't play scuba

Scuba

With the barracuda



Don't let me pull over

My senses

Rely on the finest line

The quickest time

Keep on

It's mind over matter

But it never

Has the weight for me

Delivering

But no one said

Don't play scuba

Let the cats into the bag

And simmer down

The electric that they make

Can be so great

Just simmer down



Don't let me pull over

Rely on the finest line

Recognize me nigga, look into my eyes
See raw visualizations of hate reincarnated
In it's most unadulturated form I breeth evil incarnate
Only for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds 

Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievious weeds for greed

The purpose, inseminate the bitches

Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches

Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is

The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious

Yea

Take these keys, that for years were not found

Allowing all Simeons to be freed thats locked down

It returns way back to the block

Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act

not in a manner for you to prosper

You are Ab-so-lete unless

You can handle the ball during a full-court press

When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope

Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion

known to mankind HATE!

Awww, you are sadly mistaken if you think my Aryan race

can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes

conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes

My Spikes, bald headed white laces

Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war

WHITE POWER!

What we have hear is a situation where our government

is allowing these aliens to take over the country

We can't allow this to happen! Turn your bibles to Psalms 34:21

shall be desolate."" You there!

Speak



[Prince Poetry:]



A fucking taxpayer who salutes to a Confederate flag

My chain and thoughts is on the rag

Aryan ways learned from my grand-dad

I'm on my toes around these monkeys and spics

I thank God that I'm white, pure and don't mix

We need to snatch up these niggas and fags, reissue slave tags

Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition

Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot

I'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth

Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook

Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival

Hate!

Making them Indian pay for survival

Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal

We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination

God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation

It's exerted in the good book of Revelations

Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations

So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good

No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood

Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch

But I like the way you suck my wood

Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out

But now them queers got that shit semi-reversed running about

I'm off to college with a knapsack of sacrilegious artifacts

Have you followed through once yet

In the morning when you’ve had rest

In the unknown open country

Line up at dawn to see who’s missing

My age is a metaphor

It only speaks of everything before



Daughter you wear my name

Those are my eyes keep ’em raised

I may have scars but I give more than I take

Daughter war is safe

Where you are far away

Lover are you gone

My heart has taken too much on

One octave lower than thunder it drums

Lover war is done

In more ways than just one

In the unknown open country

Like an outlaw now standing

At the foot of infinity

The sun is wild

Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go

Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible

Professional, drinkin X and ooo

Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I

Whoa

Did I think I seen shorty get low

Ain't the same when it's up that close

Make it rain, I'm makin it snow

Work the pole, I got the bank roll

I'm a say that I prefer them no clothes

I'm into that, I love women exposed

She threw it back at me, I gave her more

Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan

Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand)

What you think I'm playin baby girl

I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands



That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder

I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola

Got me like a Soldier

She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her

So lucky oo me, I was just like a clover

Shorty was hot like a toaster

Sorry but I had to fold her,

I get my records from the Rock On stall

Sweet rock and roll

Teddy boy, he's got them all



Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stompin'

Bippin' an a boppin', telling a dirty joke or two

In walked this chick and I knew she was up to something

I kissed her right there out of the blue



I said ""Hey baby, meet me I'm a tough guy""

Got my cycle outside, you wanna try?

She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes

And said ""Ooh I'd do anything for you 'cause you're a rocker""



That's right I'm a rocker



I love to rock and roll

I get my records from the Rock On stall

Sweet rock and roll

I can see they're cold and hard and pink
Hopping 'round, hopping on their two legs

Cute little legs, hopping around and...



I think of dictators who were known to have been especial brutes

And I try to picture them gathered together in their bathing suits

But when I look down at their bodies

I can see they're warm and soft and pink



Standing around, standing on their two legs

Two little legs, standing around and...



I try to meditate, control my hate just like I know I should

But I can't help myself, and I keep it up because it feels so good

But when I look down at my belly

I can see it's pink and soft and weak

Breaks to win and breaks to lose

But these here breaks will rock your shoes

And these are the breaks

Break it up, break it up, break it up!



If your woman steps out with another man

(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)

And she runs off with him to Japan

And the IRS says they want to chat

And you can't explain why you claimed your cat

And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill

With eighteen phone calls to Brzil

And you borrowed money from the mob

And yesterday you lost your job

Well, these are the breaks

Break it up, break it up, break it up



Throw your hands up in the sky

And wave 'em 'round from side to side

And if youdeserve a break tonight

Somebody say alright!

(All right) Say ho-oo!

(Ho-oo!) And you don't stop

Keep on, somebody scream!

(Owwwww!) Break down!



Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen

Breaks to make your wallet lean

Breaks run cold and breaks run hot

Some folks got 'em and some have not

But these are the breaks

Break it up, break it up, break it up!

To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?

To the girl in green, don't be so mean

And the guy in red, say what I said

Break down!



Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train

Breaks to make you go insane

Breaks in love, breaks in war

But we got the breaks to get you on the floor

And these are the breaks

And he promised you the stars in the sky

He said his Cadilac was gold

But he didn't say it was ten years old

He took you out to the Red Coach grill

But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill

TRAAJJO128F426B6AE,Mott The Hoople,American Pie,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver

With every paper I'd deliver

Bad news on the doorstep

I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried

When I read about his widowed bride

But something touched me deep inside

The day the music died



So, bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die



Did you write the book of love

And do you have faith in God above

If the Bible tells you so

Now do you believe in rock and roll

Can music save your mortal soul

And can you teach me how to dance real slow



Well, I know that you're in love with him

'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym

You both kicked off your shoes

Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck

With a pink carnation and a pickup truck

But I knew I was out of luck

The day the music died

I started singin'



Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die



Now, for ten years we've been on our own

And moss grows fat on a rolling stone

But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean

And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down

The jester stole his thorny crown

The courtroom was adjourned

No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx

The quartet practiced in the park

And we sang dirges in the dark

The day the music died

We were singin'



Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die



Helter skelter in a summer swelter

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter

Eight miles high and falling fast

Landed flat on the grass

The players tried for a forward pass

With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume

While sergeants played a marching tune

We all got up to dance

Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field

The marching band refused to yield

Do you recall what was revealed

The day the music died

We started singin'



Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die



Oh, and there we were all in one place

A generation lost in space

With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick

Jack Flash sat on a candlestick

'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

And as I watched him on the stage

My hands were clenched in fists of rage

No angel born in Hell

Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night

To light the sacrificial rite

I saw Satan laughing with delight

The day the music died

He was singin'



Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die



I met a girl who sang the blues

And I asked her for some happy news

But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store

Where I'd heard the music years before

But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed

The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed

But not a word was [Spoken]

The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most

The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost

They caught the last train for the coast

The day the music died

And they were singin'



Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

This'll be the day that I die



They were singin'

TRAAJVJ128F42570AD,Mish Mash,Kolomeyke,"hello all it's Emily um
today I'm going to do a special video
where I take my multitude of Unfinished
songs and I'm going to sing them for you
or at least the little bit that I have
so if you have any ideas for me to
continue these songs you can write them
down below and if you would like me to
continue these songs
you can like the video and that will
probably make me more encouraged to
finish these because currently I'm just
staring at them like what do I do with
these now so
yeah if you guys write songs
it's hard to get back into writing one
but
if you guys really want me to I bet I
could
so
this first one I kind of have a first
refrain or first verse and a refrain but
I don't really like them so this is the
only part that I really actually like of
this song so
goes
maybe I'm not the popular girl and maybe
I've got freckles
and maybe I'm not the one that all the
guys go for the one is fake from her
head to a toes all I have to offer is
myself
so that's number one
um let's find our next one this is my
book of all genius and songwriting
um
bought it in like third grade so it was
pretty designs on it but um this is
where I write most of my songs otherwise
they're in a purple notebook that's
around here somewhere I have too many
notebooks all right
oh here's another unfinished one
this is number two
and boy
race I know you can't take your eyes off
my face so why don't you just hold me
now and we can stay here forever yeah
kiss me now and it will always be
together oh and just be mine and I'll be
yours and we can pause in this moment
right now
so that's number two I really like that
one actually but I not really sure how
to finish it all right
oh my goodness here's my gigantic page
of Unfinished songs
see
all right let's try this one
little girl close your eyes don't be
afraid I'll hold you tonight
it'll go the world is kind in the words
of a lullaby in the world of a lullaby
in the world of a lullaby
[Music]
in the words of a lullaby
obviously that one's a little bit more
rough than other ones but that was three
so that would just be the general idea
of what the song sounds like that's not
really the actual lyrics that I might
have potentially
so here's number four
if I can make you into a song that I
would hum you all day long if I could
breathe you in and have the scent of you
on my skin if I could route you into a
letter I would fold you up and keep you
in my pocket forever and always
[Music]
I like that one all right let's see what
else do I have
oh
when I started today how did that go
again
I got this inspiration sorry that was my
dog jumping off my bed
um I got this inspiration from like
looking in a puddle on the street and I
saw this cool tree reflected in the
puddle it gave me an idea for reflection
so
um
[Music]
shoot one second I recorded myself so I
wouldn't forget how it goes like I just
did so
one second
okay so it goes and the reflections on
the water can show the surface of the
pain
and the reflections on the water can
serve as mirrors for the vein but there
are those who use the water to see
what's heading underneath but then the
ripples on the water can Morrow what we
see
Star Wars number five
so if you liked one two three or five
please tell me and I might possibly
continue them
yep
Emily out thank you for watching if you

i was lost in a world so cold carrying
stories left
untold love felt like a fading
dream slipping through my hands
unseen then you came like a gentle light
turning darkness into bright with every
word with every touch you show me love
was never lost i was afraid to try once
more scared to open up that door but
your love broke through the
pain and now i'm not afraid you make my
heart believe in love again like a
sunrise after the stormy rain every tear
every scar fades
away with you love's here to stay no
more doubt no more fear i found forever
in you my dear you make my heart believe
in
love
[Music]
again i used to think love was a lie a
fleeting shadow passing
by but you held me with hands so
strong prove that i was never
wrong now every heartbeat sings your
name love no longer feels the
same it's deeper real and so
true all because of you i was afraid to
try once more scared to open up that
door but your love broke through the
pain and now i'm not
afraid make my heart believe in love
again like a sunrise after the stormy
rain every tear every scar fades
away with you love's here to stay no
more doubt no more fear i found forever
in you my dear you make my heart believe
in
love
[Music]
again if the stars fade if the world
turns cold i know your love will still
hold you're the reason you're the proof
that love is kind that love is true
you make my heart believe in love again
like a fire that never ends every

TRAAKNS12903CC5198,Robben Ford,I Got Over It (Album Version),"hi everybody I'm Rick Beato yesterday
had the opportunity to interview one of
my guitar heroes he is American blues
jazz and rock guitarist Robin Ford for
those of you not familiar with Robin
Robin has been well known and I've known
of his playing since the early 70s Oh
five decades or so he played as a
sideman with Jimmy Witherspoon the LA
Express Joni Mitchell on the miles of
Isles record and hissing of summer lawns
he played with Miles Davis the Yellow
Jackets Larry Carlton he's played with
everybody he also has some incredible
solo records like schizophrenic city
life talked to your daughter
more recently purple house the inside
story is an older album and it was a
real honor for me to hear him talk about
his career over these past five decades
if you listen through till about 29
minutes he tells some hilarious stories
of being in Miles Davis's band you have
to check that out so without further
delay here is my interview with the
great Robin Ford
hey everybody I have the distinct honor
of being here with Robin Ford who's a
saint one of my all-time idols I don't
even know what to say I told them that
I'm very much
way too nervous to be holding a guitar
here sitting next to him so I'm just
gonna be the guitar stand for this and
if he needs a little bit of backing I
can do that I can totally handle that
but Ronnie thank you so much for thank
you for this so I want to talk I'm gonna
try and ask you questions that you
haven't been asked before I don't know
how that's gonna come out all right we
can try I was listening to the first
Yellowjackets record on the way up here
and which I mean I'm familiar with I've
been familiar with you since since the
70s and and that record is really a that
that's a incredible record and it's
really a fusion record and it has the
blues playing that you do in it you do
play you hint at the blues but it's so
much it's it's a really sophisticated
fusion record uh-huh I hate that term
fusion but but but it's harmonically
it's so it's so sophisticated I want it
I want you to talk about your blues
playing and then your jazz playing and
how you incorporate those two things and
why what what what about jazz is
interesting to you and what about blues
is interesting to you well it's
interesting to me that you would bring
up that record because I actually just
recently listened to a few tracks I
don't remember why why it came up but
somehow the record came up I actually
used a couple of the chord progressions
from the solos for act some
instructional materials and that's why I
checked it out I just needed some
something to play over that was jazzy
right so this seems to be up for me
right now for some reason but listening
to it you know maybe both laugh but also
you know kind of proud of what we did
yeah
but there is a ton of blues playing on
those records actually and
you know where you hear the
jazz-influenced is is really in any kind
of a altered 5-quart situation yes which
a lot of altered five a lot of great
lines on there that I stole from that
record right when I heard that yeah and
I heard you playing over those altered
chords that sound I had never really
heard it was that time period when I was
yeah well with the loud electric guitar
that wasn't something that was happening
really too much at that time first guy
ever heard do it was Terry Haggerty with
sons Champlin mm-hmm familiar with the
area yeah I think you know what I mean
to my knowledge he was the first guy to
crank up I think he played through a
Birdland mm-hmm he's probably playing
through a twin and cranked it up and you
know played some other notes what is it
about those notes that sounds so good
with a loud electric guitar well it
takes it much closer to like you know a
tenor saxophone yes it makes it more
harmonically it's spread out more you
know harmonically you just hear more in
the in the sound
I mean honestly for me that's why I
always talk about the blues guitar
players and saxophone players yes
because blues guitar you have all that
too and you have a variety of tones as
well there's they don't all sound the
same and jazz guitar for the most part
was a big bodied instrument on the
rhythm pickup yeah and everybody you
know and I remember getting my first
jazz instrument which was an l5 I bought
an l5 and the treble pickup was just
unusable like why did he put it aside
yeah and I was into tender players
anyway so for me it didn't matter I
didn't care so it was all rhythm pickup
and trying to play like a saxophone
players that I was enjoying and admiring
at that time but fundamentally having no
education and had
having no idea how to really play
through chord changes you know and
particularly two five one that's kind of
what the jazz thing boils down to yeah
two five one chord progression and I've
distilled that of course just to the
altered five chord kind of skip the two
chord you don't need it no and so that
that's what you hear at my playing on
the Yellowjackets record it's very
horn-like it's very sex like to me well
and again it's it's a lot of blues
playing and then there's the altered
chord you know as far as your harmonica
Cabul airy chord wise how did you
incorporate those types of voicings that
are historically that jazz players would
play and you incorporated them into your
blues playing yeah well I learned all my
chords out of Mickey Baker's book yeah
first one and started incorporating them
and verily very easily into a blues band
yeah I mean it's the same music you know
and then at some point I realized that I
didn't know how to play over those
chords improvise through them over them
you know so I learned scales out of a
book you know once again and it's like
okay that's that chord that's that you
know altered five chord sound yeah
I'd already learned the diminished scale
but for me you know the half-step
whole-step scale yeah but for me that
initially was a one chord jam because
that's the way I learned it it was you
know much more of a static chord as
opposed to an altered five chord to me
yeah like a raised nine chord so the
half diminished you know half whole tone
scale had much more of that sound of an
altered five chord to me but eventually
you know clearly the the diminished
scale could be used as a as an altered
chord and I like 13 flat nine as opposed
to flat 13 raised nine chord I would use
that you know
I just gravitated toward that diminished
scale sound you know but you also do use
that altered scale with the sharp five
in there and with the Yellowjackets on
that random right I was playing that
scale probably more yes which is
interesting because that's in your
playing
I hadn't heard you play those sounds and
that's specific to that on that
particular record there's you know you
play that and that's the thing that that
that first caught my ear because I
didn't hear a lot of people doing that
in a rock context right yeah it was I
don't think even Larry Carlton was doing
it with the Crusaders No
so they were playing much more kind of
one chord bluesy things you know so it
was a very you know early appearance of
that kind of approach in fusion music
you know what do you think about that
term fusion music well I've never liked
it either yeah but it does you know you
know I mean Miles Davis didn't like the
word jazz but it kind of describes the
genre in a way that people identify what
else would you call it I know I know
rock jazz jazz rock jazz rock she has
rock fusion what do you think of the
sophistication of audiences back in the
70s exactly
I'm sorry no but the sophistication that
people who used to have back in the 70s
and and 80s in comparison to nowadays as
far as harmonic sophistication to
listeners had you know I was talking
about that yes it's kind of an
interesting question because some um I
don't know why that door opened I don't
know why that you know sonic window
opened to where Fusion quote you know
that mixture of jazz and rock actually
became popular in some way like that's
it's a phenomenon to me now there
weren't a lot of bands that were popular
No
just a few really but I mean weather
report was so they big act you know huge
and particularly internationally and
Miles Davis the same thing you know
those guys could go overseas and play to
anywhere from you know five to fifteen
thousand people on their own you know
that doesn't happen I don't think to
anybody anymore
no so why that happened uh I'm not sure
but there was there was just a nice
little evolution you know like blues
kind of came back into some kind of
favor and then rock players started
incorporating not only blues but they
were listening to Miles Davis and John
Coltrane Grateful Dead even bounce like
that you know they were they were trying
to do what you know Coltrane and Miles
Davis and others were already doing way
better than those guys ever would but
they were trying you know I don't know
maybe that just kind of allowed people
to kind of get it and you know Miles
Davis came on very strong with the
mixture of rock and jazz and he was
enough of a legend you know I don't know
you know it's it's interesting that that
happened but it happened and it
eventually sort of you know why though
why do you think I think for reasons
that are so broad you know I mean you
could call it the cell phone you know
might have just killed virtually
everything culturally you know so I
would get very dramatic about an
answering question like that because
it's painful to me yeah to see you know
what we're seeing you know what's
happened to music it's just it's been
devastated you know in in every way
financially quality it's just been
smashed to bits you know like it's very
hard to be an artist a true artist in
this world today and you know
everybody's thinking much more about how
to sell their product because nobody's
paying for it anymore so how do you
monetize it right then making actually
great music it's very hard you know can
you talk about improvisation and the
importance of that in music hmm
you know to me it's a way of life and to
many others you know you know it's
personal expression you know so it's you
know you it's its desiring to say
something you know it's it's a need to
express oneself that's what
improvisation is right and you know that
improvisation can be done in absolutely
any medium jazz has just been this
fantastic you know evolution of
improvisation through music so you know
it's a spiritual thing you know actually
improvisation is actually it's a
spiritual thing even though I'm not
hearing much spirituality in much
improvisation these days you know like
technique has become the the art as
opposed to you know I actually have you
know kind of feeling the need to say
something so this mixture like nope
people don't know about the Blues nobody
knows about the Blues anymore and in in
America you know that's where the
spiritual thread you know just can be
traced back to you know it goes back to
the church and things land nature and
things like that so if you don't have
that connection I don't know man I don't
think it's very almost it's almost
impossible for a westerner to do
anything with any kind of heart if he
doesn't have a connection to that where
music is concerned I feel even Gillan's
so you know no more sophisticated kind
of you know it kind of clastic you know
big band arranger and everything you
know a friend of mine told me they were
walking through an airport and they and
gil evans was sitting waiting for a
plane with a boombox listening to Muddy
Waters cranked up now that you know
that's what I'm talking about it's like
you know you can be the most
sophisticated person in the world but if
you don't have that connection to the
Blues to me there's big-time something
gonna be missing in your playing tennis
that spiritual element also the ability
to make every live performance different
improvisation is
critical in that hmm yeah although I I
can go to a show where people are
imposing and every song sounds the same
yeah well at least there's the chance of
it being different every time
it's like rearranging deck chairs on the
Titanic
that's far as I'm concerned you know
it's more like the the element of melody
you know and soulfulness and expression
you know you can play things you know
backwards forwards upside down that
still sounds the same if you don't have
that you know personal expression and in
there you know if I said to you what are
some of the greatest solos what are some
of your favorite solos by other people
yeah I mean I like actually I'm not
quite sure why but before you sort of
finished your question I said I was
thinking about Mike bloomfield on the
first poll Butterfield Blues Band album
there's a song called our love is
drifting and it's just this wailing slow
blues you know but that is a blues and
just my second thought is Paul Desmond
and again then I kind of like that well
that whole record take five Paul Desmond
is the composer of the song take five
and that whole album the way Paul
Desmond plays on that record is you know
that's that's very deep you know within
my DNA and he also did a record called
Desmond blue did you ever hear that yeah
and Jim Hall's on guitar amazing and
these are that record is my favorite Jim
Hall that I ever heard and you know
often these things I think it's really
because it's the first thing you heard
mm-hmm by this artist and you connected
with it so it could have been something
else potentially but also the sound of
those records are very lush it warm you
know that golden kind of sounding to me
particularly take five that album so you
know that the first thing
that I really connected with in
improvisation
we're with people who sounded like they
were talking to me mm-hmm you know not
people who were blowing me away with
their you know amazingness you know it's
so improvisation for me I always had
that element of communication going on
you know as opposed to showing what you
can do speech through phrasing and
through being able to play France's one
that leads naturally to the to the next
like Paul does home and tone yeah yeah
there there's a person there's
personality and they're telling a story
through yeah what they're playing
they're talking to you okay as far as
players that are the great storytellers
in there instrumental improvisation x'
who were people that didn't that inspire
you
well I read you Paul Desmond
Jim Hall Sonny Rollins Miles Davis John
Coltrane did it a lot but he also did a
lot of other things but completely
capable of just playing the simplest
thing and really expressing something I
was a big fan and still AM of Roland
Kirk mm-hmm and big-time Archie Shepp
yeah particularly the records that he
did for impulse and in particular a
record called the way ahead that was
like the first the first jazz album I
ever purchased on with my own money and
didn't know what I was buying but I
wanted to learn about jazz and you know
here was a black man playing an alto
saxophone I'm like Bo that's probably
jazz and so I bought the record and it
was Ornette Coleman New York is now you
know with Elvin Jones Dewey red milkman
and Jimmy garrison so it couldn't have
been more challenging you know yeah in a
way and the second one that I bought cuz
okay
black guys saxophone Archie Shepp the
way ahead and that is just like full of
politics I mean an emotion rage you know
you the history incredible really an
incredible record you know in terms of
oh my gosh that's just amazing so um
those records and Miles Davis's records
with Tony Williams and ill excuse me Ron
Carter Herbie Hancock Wayne Shorter
Wayne shutter also loom is very large
for me in terms of influence kind of in
a different way where do you go from
here musically all the things that
you've done your whole life yeah what
what is left undone right now hmm a hit
record
I wouldn't mind that okay I've had semi
hit records you know and records that
have made a lot of noise but you know
never a true hit record have I had that
would be fun
yeah I'm not counting on it or even like
working toward it mm-hmm
in particular I can tell you that you
know what I'm really concentrating on
right now is producing records mm-hmm
and this is very exciting for me and
it's actually I wish I'd come to
Nashville a long time ago man because
it's just such an amazingly rich musical
community here that the resources are
incredible and also the Welcome I've
received here is says stunned me you
know how warm the welcome has been how
open the doors are and it's like just
amazing
maybe records is it's just about the
best thing you can do as an artist you
know you know being a cog in somebody
else's wheel not so much it's a job you
know but if you're actually working with
people who are all like interested in
your creativity you know and excited to
be there with you you know and you with
them you know this kind of thing this is
the environment that I work to create
whenever I do a record it's like let's
do this mm-hmm everybody's equally
important kind of attitude
you know even though I actually I'm the
most important I am kidding but just
that kind of collaboration you know I
don't have a home studio because I don't
want one I want an engineer who actually
knows how to do that yeah a studio
that's cool you know I want to go there
I don't want to stay home you know you
know you go into a studio it's very
different than a live performance when
you are playing and you're in the studio
mm-hmm how important is your sound I
mean obviously it's extremely important
but it's Merce what you play is really
what you're in you have to really be
inspired by your sound by what you're
having in the headphones or wherever
you're playing do you prefer to play
with headphones on if you're playing in
the studio or do you like to play
through monitors or uh or with nothing
generally for me the best thing is you
know one ear on one ear off and my
amplifier like if it's in a room door
open a bit mmm sorry I need that
interaction with my amp you know
sometimes you can get nice things
happening in front of a couple of
speakers and a console yeah sitting in a
chair sometimes yeah but honestly it's
um it's a real trip you know getting
getting getting your sound and being
comfortable as it is yeah so I'm still
learning about those things cuz I've
always you know I've used my Dumble
amplifier overdrive special yep built by
Alexander Dumbo in 1982 or three that's
when I got that amp
I've used that on every record I've ever
made my records you know yeah and I used
to use it on other people's records but
it it needs it needs to be out in an
open room it's a live amplifier and this
is something that's you know came home
to me very clearly on my last record
purple house we couldn't we couldn't fit
it we couldn't fit it into the record
because the record had been recorded in
tight
yeah you know and the amp just didn't
fit so that was the first time I really
got its like this doesn't work in every
situation because of the way we where we
record and how we recorded we needed
everything the guitars had to be coming
through small amps just the way it was
so I started getting interested in
smaller amplifiers you know such as well
I made my last record it's called purple
house and all of the rhythm parts on
that record were done through an old
blackface Pro reverb the rhythm guitars
and all the solos were done through a
reissue vibe relaxed custom which I
plugged a 12-inch speaker into it
because it it had two tens mm-hmm so I
used a single twelve cabinet and that
and I think without exception with some
kind of an overdrive pedal I you know
there's one song on the record that
isn't over driven and that is I think I
might even have played that through
somebody else's amplifier but I didn't
have the app for that record I had to
borrow by you know if I said you Robin
what sound as far as your solo tone on
what record is your favorite I think my
favorite guitar solo on record sound
everything okay is the guitar solo on
Rose of Sharon from the into the Sun
album mm-hmm I think I can actually say
that's my favorite recorded guitar solo
so that's something do you pick up your
guitar every day or do you ever go long
periods of time without playing it well
I I can go a certainly a full day
without playing it and when I was
touring more mm-hmm I wouldn't pick up a
guitar for like two weeks after I got
home you know sometimes three cuz I just
was tired of it
so I I generally you know play the
guitar with a reason I pick up the
guitar with a reed for a reason you know
I don't pick it up just to play guitar I
pick it up because I need to write
something I pick it up because I want to
work on something that came to mind you
know you know for reasons like that you
know I don't sit and play for enjoyment
very much mmm
generally it's it's for a reason and
therefore I taught a little time goes by
without playing it it's not unusual for
me you know is there something that you
want to talk about that nobody ever asks
you about you did pretty good job so
alright ask me questions that I haven't
been asked before which is great hmm I
mean we really got pretty deep there for
a minute do you ever do you ever think
you know wish I said this or I wish
people would ask me about this I can
only say that the the subject of
songwriting is something I really enjoy
mm-hmm and it's something that really
changed my relationship to to songs you
know like my appreciation for a song
certainly became greater through that
and my appreciation of lyrics you know
in particular you know was my
appreciation was greatly enhanced and
also my appreciation for words language
you know how things are said you know
all of that and what came to mind here
is you know I'll bring an entire record
you know to a group of musicians that
have been hired to make this record
mm-hmm they're all great players you
know everybody's great I'm like okay
here's this song you know so I'll sing
and play this new song for them you know
and honestly I'll today I'm always you
know
like I don't know if nervous is the
right word but a little like you know
apprehensive mitts like you know is this
song you know like any good or not I
don't know no one's ever heard it before
right so it will go through the whole
process of learning the song there
brother work at it and it's like guys oh
man I love the sound the bass you know
it's like wow yeah drum sound cool how'd
you record that I'm really good etc etc
you know good good sounds you know great
track great feel you know but nobody
ever goes cool Eric man no that's really
interesting it's probably the people
that you're playing with they don't even
they're not they're not thinking about
things like that musicians are musicians
right I was the same way you know but to
a songwriter it's a little frustrating
yeah yeah it's like nobody ever does you
know cool lyric you don't get you still
don't know if they like it or not that's
one of the things that came to mind and
talking about songwriting you know once
again is is that is a favorite subject
even though I've kind of come full
circle with that now and now I'm back to
the Epiphone on the rhythm pickup
writing you know instrumental music and
playing with people who are you know
able to play improvise you know on a
really high level Wow I mean working
with you know Bill Darryl Jones and
Keith Carlock on this last record is
like credible it's really cool - yeah it
turned out really well I'm very excited
about it I mean you've played with it
you've played with everybody and but you
still get that feeling when you play
with great players like that it's
exciting right
oh yes and it's it's I mean this
generally you know a guy like myself you
know I put together a band and go out
and tour my music right yeah you know
and I have a vision of how I want my
music to sound you know and I kind of
it's a little bit more of a direction
even though but I you know I let people
play
I want to generally play more than they
do but you know working with guys like
this it's it's a collaboration yeah so
it's like I may want it to go a
different way
this is not gonna go that way and I'm
not gonna tell him you know cuz you know
he's he's himself and he's being himself
and he's reacting to me the way I am to
him and it's like all right this is what
happens to soup you know and you're one
aspect of that soup so you don't have to
even think about directing it you don't
have to have an attitude or an opinion
about what it's supposed to be and the
more you just let it be that now we're
talking
and the improvisational thing that's
that's what it really does get exciting
and you find yourself doing things that
you you wouldn't have thought of had you
not been pushed into it this is
something that I thought about I was
watching you play with Miles Davis
there's videos for those of you that
that are on YouTube here which you're
watching this on youtube go check out
rather than playing with Miles Davis and
what does it feel like with Miles Davis
do you even think about that when you're
back when you're playing with them that
yeah I'm playing with Miles Davis he's
right on slow that's far more the
salient - yes you are in are you world
are you aware of it oh absolutely
100% at that time every moment yeah you
know we're hidden would Miles say after
after a a set would he ever say anything
miles would leave the stage before the
band did and disappear mm-hmm he'd go to
was getting a limo go to his hotel
mm-hmm and he generally traveled
separately from us okay
occasionally we were on a flight
together yeah but still you know when
you wear headphones and I'll talk to
anyone well he definitely would just do
his own thing yeah you know and he must
have communicated with you though before
you go onstage or something right and
said nah like I mean you know times in
odd places okay because you know before
we went onstage you know also he you
know you wouldn't see them know and
you'd all be by the side of the stage
and then miles would just sort of kind
of walk out you know and he'd have his
trumpet and he just gotta be
around them his tour managers trying to
hook up his wireless to him and he just
keep walking and not famous you know
we'd all go out and pick up her
instruments and he just you know so he
didn't talk to me or after the show and
we didn't travel together but every now
and then there would be a situation
where you know you were indeed in the
same room with him
okay you know and those situations were
always of course entirely unique I'll
give you an example we arrived at a
hotel after travelling together that day
and um you know we were we weren't
getting a lot of sleep so what the
routine was you went to your hotel you
ordered some room service you ate
something and you went you took a nap
and then you got up and you went to
soundcheck that's the way the day wet
right you know up early travel a long
time you know all that so I'm in my room
I've ordered room service and knock at
the door and it's Robert Irving who was
the musical director this Mouse wants to
see him like as if miles wants to see me
or in particular it turns out you know
the whole band had actually been you
know told to come to the room but when I
walk in there's only Bob Berg sitting on
a couch like the doors open I just walk
in and Bob Berg sitting on a couch at
the far side of the room there and miles
are standing in front of him he's eating
a chicken wing and then he just starts
walking towards me while he's eating
this chicken wing and he watched right
up to my face like this you know and
then he goes do you want some chicken
and then we sat around for you know
about 20 minutes a half an hour the
whole band kind of straggled in and he
just kind of wanted the band in the room
for a while and he I don't even remember
what he said or what happened you know
he said a couple of funny things I
remember and then he said man I'm going
to bed
[Laughter]
we all left so if that was the kind of
thing that would happen you know or you
know I'd see him just before you know
he's about to walk out you know he'd say
something I mean it was very
complimentary he would call me on the
phone you know and I lived across the
park from him in New York at that time
when I was playing with them and you
know I answered the phone
Robin listen to this he put a little
cassette player the eighties you know up
to the phone and just you playing your
ass off sweet you know we had we had
some actual real you know person person
you know like kind of moments that way
and one of my favorites you know oh I
had already you know was leaving the
band you know but I had like five more
shows we were somewhere and it was right
before going back going onstage and all
of us were at the side of the stage and
for some reason miles you know was
actually there with us hanging you know
and he walked up to me he took my hand
he starts shaking my hand you know and
he starts doing it like five different
ways there's a bump there's this and
that you know this spreads this I'm
sitting in the chair looking that bad
he's dead in there and he starts telling
me this story about you know when
Cannonball Adderley joined the quintet
so now it's a sextet so Coltrane's the
other player yeah and you know they came
on offstage you know after playing a
blues and you know they were playing
Straight No Chaser or something like
that no doubt you know and cannonball
said two miles you know what was that
and canvas it ain't like no blues I ever
played and he's telling me the story all
the way like I was shaking my hand like
this and it was just sort of like it was
like he was kind of including me in his
world
right in a way that just I get I'm
warmed by it you know it's like there's
like wow you know like he was treating
me like a musician you know that he
liked you know you like the way I've
played and he let me know that and so
you know it makes me emotional you know
even to think about it that I actually
got that kind of props you know from
really probably the most influential
musician for me in my life you know I
mean the Blues players you know BB King
you know he would be on that you know
that that would be just as powerful you
know and sure wish that I've been able
to spend a little time with Mike
Bluefield you know but you know he just
went away a little too soon yeah you
know but you know that that was awesome
and I quit the band after about five and
a half six months because I just signed
to Warner Brothers and honestly the
situation around him the management
didn't really treat us well mmm
the band was just kind of a disparate
bunch of people didn't feel like a group
who didn't have a band feeling to it and
and I just like okay
I think it's and he started tightening
up the music started playing more play
that [ __ ] just like the record Robin
talking about the album too - yeah oh
yeah I'm like well you know it's like
that's not why you go play with Miles
Davis right and for me and my career was
just about to begin as a solo career so
I split you know and he said to me you
ever want to come back you just come
back Wow
and that's like everything could you
hear exactly that's great it was really
awesome

Sometimes I feel like I'm fading away
You're looking at me, I've got nothing to say
Don't make me angry with the games that you play
Either light up or leave me alone



You walk in my room, you lie in my bed

You open your mouth, shoot someone dead

All of a sudden you're inside my head

Either light up or leave me alone



Spending my bread like it grew on a tree

You're trying to tell me 'bout the birds and the bees

The skirt that you're wearing is way past your knees

Either light up or leave me alone



You're up all night preaching your mind

Come home in the morning with your latest find

I'm gonna have to lay it to you straight on the line

Either light up or leave me alone",anger

Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away

I coming to see her real soon I hope

He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat



He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope

To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope

He stamped it and handed it to her to mail

Her big eyes were shining her little face pale



She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way

And when she stepped out never looked either way

A big auto hit her and sped away fast

The little girls prayers had been answered at last



The postman was passing and picked up the note

Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke

Straight up into heaven this letter did go

TRAAMGC128F42582D2,Frog Pocket,Eye Mountain,"few days ago I posted a video about why
Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their
name to KFC and my explanation was wrong
you see I explained that the name change
was KFC's way of nixing the word
Kentucky so they wouldn't have to pay
licensing fees but after posting this
video I noticed some of the comments
were claiming I was full of so I
retraced my steps and found where I went
wrong you see I got this information

Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown

I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around

The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity

But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)

See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw

I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go

Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin

Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show

So now that's how I'm livin

I do as I please, you see 

A younger brother that's up on reality

Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin

If you're born and raised in Compton



(Born and raised)

(Born and raised)

(Born and raised in Compton)



(Where you from, fool?) 

(Compton)



[ VERSE 2 ]

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see 

But then I found that it wasn't no place for me

Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit

Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit

They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role

Just because my equipment got stole

But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown

They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down

So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-

Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother

Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game

You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same

Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over

I really don't think I should have to explain

It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover

And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain

Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest

Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest

A funky dope brother never ceases to impress

My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest

I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly

Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 

Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 

Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 

Kick it



(Born and raised)



Hell muthafuckin yeah

Funky dope for the nine-ace

DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house

Yeah



(Born and raised in Compton)



Yo, check this shit out 

Right about now 

I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear

What's up nigga?

What's up KK?

My buddy D

We got AMG most definitely in the house

What's up Pretty Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin

Talkin about the Armstrong Pack

Straight got my muthafuckin back

Put it on you like its made to fit you right
Take your friends and family
Take the mile around you

Take the time that's left and step inside your life

Slip it like a glove around you

Don't you miss this love that's found you

Look at all that's real



Climb in, wear it a like a suit around your heart

You've been thinking you could not be where you are

Every morning don't be thinking where you might have been

Every morning, shake it out and step into your skin



There is no mistaking, this is where you've got to

Here's the life that you have dragged around so far

'Cause you could stretch it out

And make it fit you better



If you put it on and start with where you are

Don't be halfway out and dreaming

Don't be lost in doubt and scheming

Look at all that's real



Climb in, wear it a like a suit around your heart

You've been thinking you could not be where you are

Every morning don't be thinking where you might have been

Every morning, shake it out and step into your skin",fear

And what my heart has heard

Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Baby be mine, tonight

Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Three Sisters]
We three sisters, weird sisters indeed
Plant in Mac Beth the tyrant's seed
As it grows from thane to king

Deceit and murder is reaped



[MacBeth]

The sister's prophecy has won me title of thane

Yet I feel I'm so much more, my lady feels the same

I can be king with just a daggers thrust

Careful planning and this bloody deed is done

I cannot commit alone my lady must attend

Together we will wear the gowns of royalty in the end



[Duet- MacBeth & Lady]

We can do all things. Hand in hand

We can live as kings. Hand in hand



[MacBeth]

This night together we commit this bloody deed

No one will suspect us in doing such a thing

We'll place the blame on the servant we shall kill.

Leave no witnesses and erase our guilt

We are so clever none shall suspect

On the marrow they will place the crown on my head



[Duet- MacBeth & Lady] 

We can do all things. Hand in hand

We can live as kings. Hand in hand



[MacBeth]

We have been betrayed. Banquo; our trusted friend

Suspects our plot to be rulers of this land

Banquo you're life will be rid of this world

I shall not regret. Our innocence protect



We can do all things. We can live as kings.

We can do all things. We can live as kings.



[MacBeth]

I must seek the sisters to guide me in my plight

There must be more. I go this night



[Three Sisters]

We see apparitions. Three that show their face

Beware MacBeth, Beware MacBeth. 



We can do all things. We can live as kings.

We can do all things. We can live as kings.



[MacBeth]

Destroy Macduff on this very night

I am MacBeth, none can defy



[MacDuff]

Join me young Malcolm, rid me of this bane.

Standing together we will seize Dunsinane.



We can do all things. We can live as kings.

We can do all things. We can live as kings.



We can do all things. We can live as kings.

We can do all things. We can live as kings.



[Lady MacBeth]

I cannot rid my mind of guilt the stains of blood will not wash clean

Tonight I end this nightmare I've made and finally rest in peace



[MacBeth]

Damn my heart, my lady is gone all we've made has turned to ash

I will avenge her death on Macduff's head. No man shall take me. None of woman born!

None of woman born will take me.

Forever flung to celestial dreams

I watch the storm approaching

the darkness calls my name

the trees are growing restless

they feel the season change

their fruit has putrified

forbidden once and bound to die

the thread of life lies severed

on the brink of paradise



Grinning winds of hate unfurled

dash towers tall that grip the sun

talons stretch her veil

reclamation, our time has come...



Autumn spreads its golden wings

and lays the path for those unseen

a tangled web of evil spun at last...

Winter spawn from barren thighs

to readdress, to slay the blind

and throw the reins untethered to the skies



They pray to the full moon rising

Diana moving with such infinite grace

wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall

how many secrets can they read by your face?



Will they know of majesty

of beauty held in dream-dead sleep

and scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?

Will their ""god"" of bridled love

assuage our rule from planes above

or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?



WAR!



Wrest askew the nails

that have held you, lurking deep

September prayers are waning

burn the shrines of fettered sheep

Spearhead the insurrection

of a world that seeks no end

""We are what we are, what we shall be, again...""



Appear; draped in terror

to the comfort of your kin

Stain the milky sunset red

and let the other in...

TRAANRS128F92E4F27,Her Space Holiday,The Telescope,"He lived alone
with his books and his records and his telescope
with all the doors locked
days piled upon each other one by tedious one
until the pressure finally created a diamond like thought
and he was instantly sad

Ive read every book,

Ive heard every song,

and Ive seen every star from the safety of my bedroom.

and i am empty.

in defeat he slumped forward with his eyes still pressed against the telescope

just then his lungs began to expand,

he blinked rapidly,

alternating his eyes between squinting

and making his eyes as wide as saucers

he cried out, of course

with all the hours spent looking up

it never crossed his mind to veer straight ahead.

He spent days upon days taking it all in

he say children grow to become men

and men grow to become fools.

he saw hope, beauty, war, strength, weakness, chaos, stillness

he watched until he could recite each scene from memory,

eventually he wrote his own books about what he saw

and he made his own songs about what he thought he had heard

until almost he himself believed what he was creating to be true

until lie upon lie piled on top of itself

until the pressure finally created a pearl-like thought

he spoke to the world,

Ive seen all of your lives

and Ive heard all of your conversations,

and i am hungry.



In frustration,

he dropped to his knees

and began to bang his head against the old wooden door

of course he cried out

and without hesitation

ha stood up,

put on his coat and hat, and turned the knob.

but before hid first step even hit the ground

he was faced with the most unexpected of emotions

one that he could only figure to be

what his favorite books and records refer to as love.

where are you going? she asked him

i don't know

me too she smiled

ill take you there, she extended her tiny hand

and swept him away with her.



They walked until their feet bled

during their journey she told him all the places she had been

and all the people she had met along the way.

a new emotion began to unfold inside of him

one he thought he had overheard in a conversation looking through his telescope

it was the word fear

why would she choose me? he thought.

i know so little

not wanting to lose her interest,

he began telling her stories he thought she might be impressed by

but all they did was make her question his strength and ability to battle the enemies

that she knew would surely jump out at them one day

but she still kept her faith in him and they continued walking



what amazing things they saw

they danced in dark caves,

warmed their faces by the brightest of fires,

and played with brilliant children in the blue Spanish sea

but even amidst all that gorgeousness,

their hands began to slip.

first from palms, then to fingertips, then to nothingness.

they stood still,

she faced south, and he faced west.

he called out to her,

I'm leaving now, and i blame you for the state we're in

and through all of our adventures Ive done nothing wrong

and though you've taught me how to breathe,

I'm taking my new voice and leaving you hear with nothing.



She looked back and cried out to him,

we drew a map together that you promised you would follow with me.

i too am scared,

especially after you stole my strength and made it your own.

but i am still reaching for your hand,

knowing it will fit more perfectly than ever

if you will only reach back to me.

but he didn't reach back, he was vain and confused.

he tried to make a new map, but he didn't know where to put the X anymore.

so he walked in circles,

he lost his rhythm,

he froze by the fire,

and he drowned in the sea,

he made himself what he had feared the most,

incomplete.

and even though the decision was his, and his alone,

he blamed her for that too.



but the whole time she followed him

looking for fallen twigs and fresh footprints to see where he was going

but all he left in his path were messages written in the dirt with a broken stick

scrawled lies of anger and shifted blame,

until one day he wrote the word help when he needed her most.

but by then she had stopped trying to read his thoughts

and make sense of his misery.

so he headed back to where he started,

back to his books and his records and his telescope,



Battered and broken,

he finally reached the edge of his street

only to find her waiting for him.

and upon seeing her soft smile,

he immediately knew what he had done,

he knew what he had lost,

he knew how sorry he was.

for the first time she was real to him.

they sat and spoke about everything they should have

in the beginning of their story

and through all the tears he learned that she had been walking her entire life

and that she wasn't waiting for him to go into the world with her at all

no, she was in fact waiting for him to invite her into his house

so she could read his books, hear his records and look through the telescope

behind the safety of his locked door.



what a fool he thought

i didn't realize that with all this time i spent looking out this window

you were right there looking back at it.

at me, at this, at us.

i already had what you had been traveling these roads searching for.

she crumbled under the weight of hearing her own truth.

and through their honesty,

they were both as strong as they can be

and now under the relief of each note of forgiveness

no thought appeared to them, just a feeling.

and he whispered to her,

Ive seen your efforts,

and i can feel your love for me,

and i am whole.

i still have places to visit and mistakes to make in private

but take my home and make it your own,

recite lines from my favorite books in the garden,

hear the songs closest to my life while you sleep in my bed,

and look through me waving at you through my telescope.

he raised his hand and he rested it on her chest,

and he drew an X across her heart.

of course he thought.

he slowly closed the old wooden door

and he locked it behind him

Through their great, untrustworthy lands. In the darkness, he took the silence away. In the darkness, he took the silence away. And the tears that blaze down a face. Fear that they'd start, and won't go away. I was curled up for nothing on the bathroom floor. He waited, he waited and stayed and stayed true. In the darkness, he took the silence away. In the darkness, he took the silence away. In his eyes, he tells me how it goes. How sorrow has a language, and there is too much yet to know. And how there's strange joy in the slightest, no matter how hard, how hard, how hard... it is to get past these broken doors. And, in the darkness, he took the silence away.

[Intro One: from the motion picture ""The Usual Suspects""]
There's no coke!
What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke!

What the fuck do you mean, there's no coke?

I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fuckin room!

There's gotta be coke!

There is nothing! NOTHING!



Huh, uh, uh, help please!

Huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, help me! *gunshot*



[Intro Two: Masta Killa]

It's assassi, it's assination day, I stalk...

It's assassination, I sta...

It's assassination day... 

It's assassination day, I



[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]

Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light

Invite the fight, we all die tonight

The life I lived, a 25 to life bid

Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive

CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk

Three G's accost in Supreme Court

White lies and blackmail land me back in jail

We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail

Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind

It comes time I take back what was once mine

Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter

Devil's poisonin the birth water

The earth daughter rest her head on my chest

Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest

While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin

Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh

Trapped in deep-water gaspin

I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action



[Verse Two: RZA]

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears

Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears

You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered

Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted

MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic

Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice

You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable

One nation under God, indivisible

With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches

Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches

Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel

Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable

Interchangable, caution flameable

My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles

And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle

Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal

Retrieve through your doors

Seep out like sweat through the pores

Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare



[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]

(Assassination day)

First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon

Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon

Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb

Action word, flowing like a blackbird

God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw

He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah

You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga

Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras

You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high

Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow

You won't play me like your lady

Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby

Final destination Haiti



[Verse Four: Masta Killa]

War is extremely serious and it saddens me

To have to take tings to deadly measures

And have you measured and shot for no pay

It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey

Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives

And lures MC's to the lair

With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed

Temptation tempts my victim to proceed

Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat

You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat

Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 

Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin

My mind spits with an enormous kickback

Your brain didn't absorb the impact

Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...



It's assassination day, I

It's assassination day

It's assassination day

It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy

It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy",anger

TRAAOGR128F425E7BF,Say Anything,We Killed It,"The girl could move, and she did.
We were captives on a casino ship.
Where the midwest lay out hours and burnt to crisp.
I spent a year as her hair lip,
but now I fall apart at night 

and dream about our trip.



But the first two weeks were great,

I felt content to watch the Entertainment Channel fornicate.



With flashes of you maturing into stage,

flawless masterpieces built of dreams I swore were memories.



And I dream, I dream, I dream..



I saw the ocean envelop the sky

Put out the sun on the day that we died,

The former, the latter, and all in between,

They were vanquished by looking a fiend.



Do you remember me, do you remember me?

The one that you loved when he set you free.

Do you remember me, do you remember me?

The one with who you fell beneath the sea.



Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night.

[Forte': Speaking]
Political science...
The study of politics, mixed with science...

Speak on it, baby...



[Jeni Fujita: Singing Chorus]



As I look in your eyes

I see the sunrise

I see the moonshine!



[1st Verse: 20 Grand Pikasoe]



I'm from the days of the Colt 45's and gang bangers

Cocaine slangers who sliced doors, no time to cook up

Them niggas like raw

It's all about the dollar now, white powder now

He owed us money so I watched my niggas tie him down

The conflict is crucial, police is neutral in this battlefield

Where the battles grill, like cattles grill for a platter mil

I even watched little Darryl deal

I love the ghetto, hate the ghetto

Must've been a genius who helped make the ghetto

So I sit back and taste the 'retto

I got beef, how can you misplace my metal?

It's a sob story, it's bad the way they robbed Tory

Of course, must've been religious

'Cause they took a small tainin' across

Wrong game to play, boss

Every night's a bug out

They shot up every corner where I hung out

Some nights I cry to this

Even though it's posi-flip (?)



[Singing chorus: Jeni Fujita]



It's like the sunrise

Just like the moonshine!



The rain stops, and your girl smiles...just for you (Yeah)

For you don't know, the love I have for you!



[2nd Verse: Forte']



Mommy, I keep my name on your brain like Missy

With The Rain, I'm from the school of stolen sneakers

Speakers and heavy chains, no lie

To the knowlie, why?

God see I , learned the ways of the street, degrees in Poly Sci

Many days under heat

It pays for sticking him

Watch him beast on the lean, routine curriculum

Black vans, maybe a TransAm, exams get done

Pop Quiz, figure out them niggas who hit son

God give, God take away

And it's easy to see

Spell 'til, the lord kill indiscriminately

We infinitely excel, keep the fans compelled

The bigger picture, watch the ones who're wit' ya

I clean the pie, and seen 'em die

Travel life more than once

Maybe, me and I...had been greeted by, so many conceded eyes

That'd be wise, when I met too many girls around the world

And delete the lies



[Singing Chorus: Jeni Fujita]



It's like my music, a new tune you never heard

Hear, your heart beat

The bass hits! And you feel it

It's real it's not a sample! I saw you playing my piano!

Unh-Huh!



[3rd Verse: Forte]



Now I, rock jew-els now and then

A little lights - n - platinum

A little beef on the street, no harm in clappin' them

Savage nations, ghetto life no ramifications

Dead debating, keeping every crackhead basing

My auntie steady saying that we wasting, money

I like tasting, the finer things in life, like a mason

Police, plague - hatin'

Everything that the court own

Brownsville would pry, classified as a warzone

The Brook god, so trife

Originale low-life

To sport it, boost it, the ghetto can't afford it

Trade it, sort it, stress, new port it

No tags never ordered

You broke it, you bought it

A twenty five - to life, my little son-son caught it

'Til this day, we admit it, that we did it, he 'gon bid it

Kept his mouth shut, and never shitted

On who his murder flirted with death

Like every team, aiight! You know the verdict!



[Forte: Speaking]



Want me to say it one more time Ma, is that what you want?...



[Jeni: Singing]



Say one more time!



[Forte: Continues]



For every city blocker, glock rocker

Cats who get they weight off, for every kid who had a parent laid off

No healthcare, had us co-dependents out on welfare

Speak amongst yourself, 'cause in the streets, no one else care

The powers that be, I see you knelt there

Them jealous cats who slang crack, I'm glad to send you back, 

'cause you dealt there 

We all wanna shine for basis, 'til we easy

LG for GP, only the realest niggas meet me

Conversing through the wee-wee hours of the morning, sleepy

Always stay alert, 'cause the pain hurt too deeply

Ain't nothing changed, I'm stuck on myself

'Cause you mundane

You wonder while you're just gold?

You're stuck on one plain

Now we must hold, very fueled make it through the threshold

I'm blessed though, the head distincts before I let go

A major death toll

It's all about the babies, fuck the best coast

I keep my family eating, 'til I'm done breathing



[Jeni Fujita: Singing Chorus]



Hear, your heart beat! [Forte'] (- You heard?! .....Nutzbaby)

The bass hits, and you feel it

It's real, it's not a sample! I saw you playing my piano!

Unh- Huh!



All you had to do, was make a record! Yeah

All you had to do, was make a record! Say one more time!

Your necessary silhouette
Unknown, join the dissidents
Got carried away
Now hiding from their lies and discords

Once remembered now forgotten



Come roll the dice for me

Roll the dicefor me



Hold on better undone

If really on your own

Thinking this is fun?

Feathers fallen from drapes

Fold her into pieces

Tied up and lace



Fences in a row

fences in a row

Wired and protected

In a Row...



Got carried away

Thought I would've let you know

Did you miss a message?



I know you still

Would rather mess with me than get going

She's been building up a castle in L.A



Roll the dice for me



Hold on better undone

If really on your own

Feathers fallen from drapes

Fold her into pieces

Tied up and lace



Fences in a row

fences in a row

Wired and protected

In a Row...

We were lying in bed, just the two of us under cover, undercover
With no warning you suddenly became my lover
I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me, say it to me
I've been skating, skating on thin ice if I don't agree

I know you're the one for me but it took me by surprise

And If I say it back to you, I can't look you in the eye

I don't want to lose you, I don't want to confuse you

I guess that this is my cue, to give you my reply



And you killed it, you killed it

You killed it with I love you

And you killed it, you killed it

You killed it with I love you

And you killed with I love you

What am I supposed to say back to you?

You killed it with I love you



And I'm sorry

only three little words I seem to be so scared of

so please show me how to get these words

off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind



I know you're the one for me but it took me by surprise

If I say it back to you, I can't look you in the eye

I don't want to lose you, I don't want to confuse you

I guess that this is my cue, to give you my reply

You killed it with I love you

And you killed it, you killed it

You killed it with I love you

And you killed with I love you

What am I supposed to say back to you?

You killed it with I love you



I have been thinking about what you said

Three little words running round in my head

There's no one else that I'd rather be next to

I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you",surprise

Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin

makes your heat pistons freeze

I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures

With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers

Who discredit theories and behead your mentors

Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge

I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst

Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over

Wearing grim smirks

They would like me to convert my gritty edge

To unearth my earning potential

But my face is so sun burnt

Due to all the grassroots grunt work

That I won't be co-opted

And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped

But I'm a street vendor kinds sir

This style-free is dopamine

It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening



You can join my suicide cult

Membership is free

Take these cyanide eye-drops

And peppermint hemlock

This is what you have been billed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

This is what you have been killed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score



Contrast bohemia to my workplace

When I'm racing in carpool lane

to sell shit to an art school lame

-Don't you think you're hot shit

Well what do you have to offer-

A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe

But they can they pinpoint and nail

My distance between art and commerce

With just an invoice of a sale

I will disappoint an ail

Those who want to deny us the majority rule

When a will jump in my primordial pool

Without knowing where their swim trunks were

But not everyone knows

What they're called on to encumber

You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

Buy now

You pasty Brits

Buy now

You crazy chicks

Buy

Cuz I don't pay attention to rules,

regulations or safety tips

Love us

Eligible bachelors

Love us

Cuz we're the Blowed rappers

Loved

Cuz I tour the country so much

I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas

Unrelated to your three-legged

preachy bootleggers will do away with you

CD duplicators make vegans

Do the salad bar swing-pivot

Wave your valid parking tickets

At the endangered sea-urchin

Tell me the name of your political activist key person

And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version

Of the infamous rap rant

Trickling down the baggy pant leg

of this unhappy class aid

Covered in shell fragments of this

Graffiti tagged glass egg

I can sell anything to a hip-hopper

like it's my cathartic something

But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting



You can dance to death

And for no extra charge

Give me your debit card

So you can have sex with stars

This is what you have been billed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

You have always been my wildflower
Showing up wherever beauty's lost its way
Your heart must break
I was free

Until I heard the song you sang me to me

Pulling me away from everything I knew

To be with you



And everything I know just fades away

And every time you go it hurts me so

I don't know why when I know we're free

Free to fly



Here we are

Burning faster than the cursed star

Falling back down to the Earth

I love you so it sometimes hurts



Closer still

You will find me standing on the hill

Waiting for you with my arms stretched open wide

Now, come inside



And everything I know just fades away

And every time you go it hurts me so

I don't know why when I know we're free

Free to fly



And everything I know just fades away

And where the wildflower grows it picks its space

And that's the way it is when nature plays its lovely hand

We'll understand everything



Everything, everything",sadness

To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling ""No""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks

through her sunken dream

To the seat with the clearest view

And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore

For she's lived it

ten times or more

She could spit in the eyes of fools

As they ask her to focus on



Sailors fighting in the dance hall

Oh man!

Look at those cavemen go

It's the freakiest show

Take a look at the Lawman

Beating up the wrong guy

Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know

He's in the best selling show

Is there life on Mars?



It's on Amerika's tortured brow

That Mickey Mouse

has grown up a cow

Now the workers 

have struck for fame

'Cause Lennon's on sale again

See the mice in their million hordes

From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads

Rule Britannia is out of bounds

To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore

'Cause I wrote it

It's about to be writ again

TRAARLK12903CD3764,Casino Versus Japan,You Were There,"In this video, I am going to try some of the
weirdest hotels in Japan.
Some are futuristic, some are borderline
How the f**k is this legal?
One type of hotels are very popular in Japan,
which are love hotels.
Most of them are normal h**kup hotels.
Like the ones we have in India, which you might have used.
But here, they have been around for centuries.
Now, Tokyo is like Hong Kong or Mumbai in some ways.
In the sense, people stay in very small sized apartments here.
 
Which are very tightly packed.
Now, this Airbnb, which is relatively small,
It was written on its page that this is larger than usual size.
 
So, this is where love hotels come into the picture.
They are pretty much a regular part of life here.
Because people use it like normal hotels.
Because they tend to provide better value than normal hotels
Now, although most of these are normal hotels,
Some of them, especially where we are going,
Is a literal s*x dungeon.
So, without wasting any time,
It's going to be 10 am now.
I have a check-out from this Airbnb.
I have to check into another hotel.
And then, we are going to try multiple,
very explicit love hotels by backdropping there.
So, we are going to our first location.
Hotel Alpha Inn.
All the rooms here have different equipment.
I'm talking cross.
There's whips.
There's chains.
There's open toilet.
Like this.
In an open room.
There's open cross.
Like Jesus Christ's cross.
It's for people who like B*SM and S&M.
Here, people's eyes and @sses both open.
This is the weirdest sh*t I've ever seen.
But before that, I need my necessary equipment.
Tell me.
I'm not getting any monster here.
This is going to affect my overall review of Japan.
I'm not getting any monster easily here.
And I'm sure the president of Japan cares about my review.
So, the main difference between OYO and the love hotels here is,
Love hotels here run on two systems.
Kiyuki, which is the rest rate.
In which you can stay for a few hours.
And Shakuhaku, which is the night rate.
In which you can stay overnight.
Where is it?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Damn, bro.
I am stocked for half a day now.
Bro, do you know?
The smallest size in the US is 500 ml.
Bro, I forgot my wallet in the old AirBnb.
At least I didn't forget my GoPro.
At least I forgot my credit cards.
In which all my savings are kept.
In all the environments of happiness and sorrow,
One thing is always with me.
So, one thing if you have noticed.
The gates of Tokyo Metro are already open.
Because they expect that you will pay.
Like there is so much trust.
There is so much civic sense in people.
That everyone pays.
And to also save time.
So, everyone comes and taps their card.
And the gate stays open.
So, the hotel we are going to.
Hotel Alpha Inn.
It is 40 minutes away from here.
It is very far from central Tokyo.
We have to first take this JR line.
The green one.
Which will take us from Shin-Okubo Station.
To Yoyogi Station.
Then from Yoyogi Station.
To Azabu Line.
So, yesterday when I took the Tokyo Metro pass.
This one.
This is only valid on Tokyo Metro.
Whereas, the JR line has a separate ticket.
Which is not valid on this.
I am still trying to find the IC card.
So that I don't have to buy these tickets again and again.
There is so much hassle in this.
Thank you.
Wait, I think I will get that card.
Here it is.
Purchase.
Let's go.
Bro, I will keep it decorated.
The one with the name.
It has 500 yen extra.
Okay.
Zaid ZIZ
That's not even my government name.
Gender? Other? No.
Let's go.
Come on.
So, Tokyo Metro.
If you don't know.
It's not just one.
Like Delhi Metro.
It comes under DMRC.
Tokyo Metro.
There are many companies in that.
And JR is also separate.
This is Suica card.

It will be available everywhere.
Not to mention.
This is basically the equivalent of Hong Kong's Octopus card.
With this, I can go to 7-Eleven.
And buy pretty much Monster.
Yes.
Most likely, I can buy a Macbook with this.
In the hotel.
I can buy a girl with this.
You can buy a girl.
Bro.
Tokyo Metro.
It's so calm.
When I called him.
He couldn't pick up the phone.
Because it was not allowed in Tokyo Metro.
Bro.
In New York Metro.
People come with dinner.
carpet, etc.
They spread a mat and eat there.
Here, Spider-Man will jump and come.
Someone is vomiting there.
Bro, He is saying it's full.
You come to Mumbai local once.
you'll know the real struggle.
This crowd is nothing compared to Mumbai
This is Mumbai's off-time Sunday crowd.
This is running there.
Bro.
It's so fun.
Bro.
I am not going to lie.
Scooter is not fun.
E-bikes are fun.
We have reached.
On the dungeon of Diddy
Let's see who we meet.
Will we see anyone?
Or everything will be done with the machine.
Wait.
Is it this?
This is so dodgy.
Just put it between the cheeks of two buildings.
Bro.
This looks so weird.
Bro.
What the f**k?
Bro.
There are literally ti**ies out
Ti**ies out.
It's a p*rn magazine.
It's so big, Who is taking this inside.
Is it safe to touch it?
Bro.
We have made fool of that aunty.
That two girls are coming to the bar.
No one is coming.
We will leave this place as soon as our filming is done.
Bro.
What is this?
What kind of a hospital is this?
I don't know.
It's written here.
let's see what is available?
Wait, Let's do this.
203.
What the f**k?
What the f**k?
Bro, in old times, people used to use this stuff
Like diving into the poochie that hasn't been washed in months.
yeah because they are not used to bath
Bro.
They told us that baby oil is not allowed.
Baby oil is a bit too much right now.
I wish I had that Dubai black light.
UV light.
I would have turned off the light and scanned.
It already looks very dirty.
I don't think I should sit on this.
Bro.
They will take a screenshot of this and
 post it on my subreddit.
Bro.
I am actually so excited to use this on you.
What the f**k?
Bro.
If you were a bandra b**ch.
If you were a bandra b**ch.
If you were a certain goregaon b**ch.
You would be here right now.
It's for legs as well.
Yes.
Wait a second.
Does the girl come here and the guy or@ls?
It's up to you.
Okay.
Both can use it.
If I am the guy here.
You will f**k me up.
If the guy is here.
Then the legs will be here.
And these legs will be here.
And the girl will f**k me up.
She will f**k you up.
Bro.
I am not into p*gging.
Sorry.
Wait a second.
I think this is the washroom.
How do you come to the washroom?
Is this the washroom?
Oh f**k.
Dude.
I haven't seen one of these since Jaipur.
I haven't seen a washroom like this since Jaipur.
Now there are western toilets everywhere in India.
This is in my old Jaipur house.
I used to use it then.
Those were the days.
Free jet spray.
There are all the amenities here.
Shampoo.
After shave lotion.
Hair brush.
Essence cream.
There is face wash.
There is TV.
And I am going to be honest.
There are a lot of DVDs.
DVDs.
A lot of toys.
A lot of magazines.
Which you can bring with you anytime.
Oh bro.
I can become Jesus Christ.
What is this?
Bro is not a fashion hotel.
What is he thinking?
That he can hide himself.
What is he disguising himself?
Is he a police officer?
What is this?
This is not a condom.
When they have come here.
Condom is the least of their worries.
I mean they are not putting it in such a place.
From where a person can get pregnant.
Bro I want to show you some reviews of this hotel.
Lara has written.
Lots of drinks.
Lots of kinky stuff in the room.
Large bed.
I think it was worth it.
Apart from the toilet.
Hole in the ground.
By the way.
In this hotel.
In some rooms.
Toilet is just like this.
In front of the bedroom.
Just like this.
There is no separation.
There is nothing.
And what we were seeing.
In the magazine.
There are girls literally.
P**ing and sh*tting.
Who is into that fetish?
Japanese people look very innocent.
They are innocent in looks only.
Someone has written.
My p*ssy broke here.
Then why did he give one star?
Five stars.
Put your slippers in the door.
Two couples intrude.
Well, I guess it was fun.
Nice to meet you again.
D.O.M Kun.
D.O.M means dominant.
Oh, damn.
There's a rumor here.
It's not a rumor.
It's pretty much accepted.
If you stick your shoes outside the room like this, it is
okay that anyone can come in and join.
Bro...
According to the rumors, a room with slippers stuck to the
door is a sign that it's okay to break into the room.
Should we keep our shoes here?
Who will come?
What if the boys come behind?
If it's a boy, we'll make him run away.
We have to keep these slippers.
Imagine if someone is 6'4"", 3 inches tall.
Almost my height.
We can either get a Latina or an A tall African American man
who is thinking,
I found two guys today.
I found two guys from India.
Bro, within five seconds...
Within five seconds, a man showed up.
There was something in his gown.
He looked like a Buddhist.
Overall, because normal hotels come for 15,000 to 20,000
per night.
You will get these love hotels around 2,000 to 8,000
depending on how much equipment you have. So, for example,
this has a decent amount of equipment.
This cost us around 7,000 approximately.
And you can basically stay here for 3-4 hours.
So, the price is a bit expensive.
Also, we were going to try the love hotel food here.
It's a huge menu.
I think they have a partnership with Domino's.
So, they will come inside the room and deliver the Domino's meal.
I saw one thing in this.
No golden shower play.
Enema play.
What is enema play?
Is it related to sh*t?
I remembered two girls for one cup.
And candles are...
Candles just sound dangerous.
Are allowed on the bed.
Okay, on the bed.
You can do it on the floor.
You can do it on the floor.
Golden shower.
You can do whatever you want.
I'm seriously reconsidering why the f**k I sat on there.
What all they must have done.
I think they have cleaned it very well.
There are cups on this too.
Did you jump down?
Damn, they actually cleaned the sh*t out of this.
When we used it in Dubai, we picked up the mattress.
It was full of marks.
One thing is expected from Tokyo and Japan.
Yes, even if you hit your fist, it will be clean.
This hotel is...
Bro, this is their Margarita.
It's so plain in India.
Hopefully, this isn't as though.
It's decent.
Decent, 7 on 10.
I was saying that this hotel is perfect for someone who
wants to stay for 3-4 hours. It's best for them.
Because all the hotels here check-in time is 4 o'clock.
Okay, we took it.
Now we just have to make an excuse.
According to the reception, why didn't the girl come?
Our girl came.
But she's a little kinky.
So she climbed from the balcony and came.
I'm the girl.
Yes!
Okay, do you remember when I said that this place is a
little far from the center?
It's not.
If anything, it's central.
It just feels far because
Tokyo is one of the places where central Tokyo isn't that crowded.
Like, you can see the streets.
Whereas areas like Shibuya, Shinjuku, which are a little
outside of central Tokyo, they are always crowded.
So since we're here, we thought we should go and see the
Tokyo Tower. It's pretty much like the Eiffel Tower.
It's actually bigger than Eiffel Tower.
Like, a little.
But when you stand below the Eiffel Tower,
you get goosebumps.
From a distance, it just looks like a B-Tech mobile tower.
But when you stand below it, it's iconic.
So we've booked the top-deck tickets for the Tokyo Tower.
They were not that expensive.
I think it's around $30.
And it's a walking distance from here.
So we thought, let's check it out.
Bro, I'm glad I got the top-deck tickets.
Otherwise, I was going to get the main-deck tickets.
Bro, this is nothing.
Bro, these are the average apartments in Mumbai.
Bro, the view is so clear.
It's all about pollution, bro.
You can't even see the buildings up to here in Mumbai.
And you're from Delhi, you're in hell.
You're practically in hell.
No, Mumbai's skyline is also s*xy.
It's just that pollution is going on.
This is my office.
36th floor.
They'll be able to see my office.
Bro, his office is very s*xy.
He has to go to the office only twice a week.
Like, everything else is remote.
And he has a Saturday-Sunday holiday.
Saturday-Sunday holiday.
And he gets a holiday on Monday too.
Yeah, he got a holiday on Monday too.
He took paid leave for me.
And he got it easily.
Do you know what I asked for in that shrine?
Big fat stacks of money to all my subscribers.
Should I just write,
Long live Jaipur.
Jaipur represent.
Jaipur is now part of Tokyo.
Now, I can claim this.
I put Jaipur on the map.
Bro, we're on the top floor now.
And holy f**king sh**.
There's no view of the main deck in front of this.
You can see everything from here.
I told you, it's all Tokyo.
You can see the whole Jaipur from here.
Yeah.
People talk a lot about Tokyo.
The thing about Tokyo is, It literally never ends.
The mountains you can see in the back,
That's also a part of Tokyo.
Like, I'll put the map of Mumbai over the map of Tokyo.
And you'll realise the difference.
It is that huge.
And it has the highest population in the world.
Don't underestimate Delhi.
We'll overtake it.
As we're recording this,
Someone is getting back sh*ts in OYO.
In Dwarka.
Okay, Tokyo Tower was cool.
Now we're going to a love hotel.
Which is technically not a love hotel.
But it is a love hotel.
It's a love hotel where you can make love to yourself.
It's a solo love hotel.
Like, the internet cafes we're going to are so cheap,
That people have settled there.
And they live there.
And then they change and then they go to another internet cafe.
And it's very cheap.
I think Tokyo's rent is 70-80% cheaper.
But it's tiny as f**k.
Let's see.
Bro, this is such a long queue.
Bro, look at the crowd behind you.
Bro, what kind of crowd is this? It's called polling.
Will they come?
The ones who push.
Have you seen that video?
Okay, I take my statement back about Mumbai local.
This is just as crowded.
 Internet is available
That's so many rooms, 230
Bro this is crazy
This is literally crazy
First of all, let me show you what facilities are available here.
There is a telephone, tissue papers, actual TV
Which you can use as a computer
Like you can literally sit here and play games for hours
I can do video editing sitting here
There are so many cushions above, CPU and
 then we obviously have mirror
Bro you won't believe how much we got this
First of all, internet capacity is available in hours
We got this for 350 Yen, 180-200 rupees
Are you seeing this sh*t?
Which is why it is becoming an epidemic
Japanese people can permanently stay here
Because if you take out rent for a month, it would be
nowhere close to the rent that's in Shinjuku
And not to mention, food is included in this
We can literally go and eat free curry
Like there is a buffet here
And I think there was a coffee machine here
Yes, drinks are free, maybe we can get free drinks
Drinks are free bro
In 200 rupees 200 rupees, man
So many people must be listening
Such a small room
Bro, what I am saying is that 2 people can sleep here
And there is good heating
Bro, it is so chill here
Also, by the way, you won't even see tourists in such
internet cafes
Because mostly Japanese men don't come here
Because first of all, you will have to fill all the forms
in Japanese
I want to show you some reviews of this place
Miho rated it 1 star
The male staff entered female public bathroom without any warning
Extremely inappropriate and no apology was given
Mr. T rated it 5 star
On weekdays, it is possible to stay for 12 hours at
midnight for 17 pounds
See, how much is it? 1400-1500 rupees
Bro, that is crazy
In Shinjuku, in central Shinjuku
One guy rated it 1 star
There was a man dressed as a woman in the women's public bath
And he was secretly photographing
Should we go and check?
Let's go and check the amenities
They also gave you slippers
All these mangoes are also available here
And of course
Japanese people, they never forget about ti**ies
Like there is literally a n*de woman
And it is easily available in every 7-Eleven
Can we take this to the room?
I guess
What do you mean, I guess?
This was its main selling point
People must have done this in the olden days
Like this
Like when there's no internet, they just sit in the
washroom like this.
I can't even imagine like being Gen Z and before that it
was different.
Everything was just imagination.
Oh! Akira!
Damn! This is sick.
You can literally sit for 3 hours and read so many things.
Bro, I wish something like this existed in India.
I imagine some people come everyday just to finish their
favourite book.
If there's anything you're getting from this video, is that
if you ever come to Japan, learn a little bit of Japanese.
Enough to fill the form of an internet cafe and just come and sit.
Read whatever is your favourite manga.
It is so cheap.
And free food.
And shower.
And computer.
And bed.
Okay, fried rice.
What is this? Dal?
Curry.
Okay, so this is the food that we got for free.
This is curry.
This is rice and fried rice.
Both are separate.
We are surrounded.
Surrounded by mangas.
There's a drink machine at the back.
Bro, this is so cool.
The food is good.
Bro, even if the food was bad, this would still be good
value for money.
Hmm! This is actually good.
It's better than the Korean fried chicken that I had in the morning.
Bro, it was so sweet.
I don't know why most of the food in Japan is so sweet.
But this is good.
It's still sweet.
Bro, if we eat this outside, it'll be for 500-600.
And here, we can get unlimited.
What is this?
I think this looks like Amazon Prime.
Wait, what is this?
This shortcut was already set on the computer, by the way.
And should I press yes on this?
What the f**k?
What the f**k is this?
This shortcut was already set.
By the way, these are the icons on the desktop.
Wait, what?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
This room is really nice.
What all can we do in this room?
You can rent a room and watch a movie in it.
While reading manga and eating.
Okay, we are in Toshima right now.
And we are going to Muscle Girls Lounge.
Here, buffed up girls beat up boys.
Like, you can literally pay girls to slap the s**t out of you.
If there's anything I've learned in Japan, is that every
fetish has a hotel and a cafe.
I'm still getting used to the weirdness.
It's very noisy.
This is a grapefruit squeeze.
Do you guys want to get wet?
No, no, no, no, no.
No? Okay, then stay back.
We can order as many as...
I'll take a protein shake and orange juice.
Bro, there's so much protein shake.
Here, people are giving money to get smacked by these girls.
If you fill up a six-pack, you can even leave a bazaar.
Over there, a girl is dancing on a skateboard.
Over there, a girl is pulling up.
Over there, a girl is pulling up.
See, this is the final boss.
The reason I was coming in front of the camera again and
again is because this is all streamed on Twitch.
Now, people are going to hit me with comments.
Some scumbag is going to say, this is for everyone.
So, what I was saying was, this is the menu.
You can literally pay a girl to slap the s**t out of you.
And you can pick any girl by the way.
Or all of them.
This is one slap.
This is one slap on @ss...
This is all muscle girls.
they will slap one by one
whose fetish is this?
What was that?
And I don't even know how much I'll be able to put in the video.
I'll have to blur it out.
The next day.
Bhai, I've realized this one thing.
If you're in a foreign country, and you don't like the food
there, there are two cuisines you can always rely on.
Indian and Italian.
No matter where you are in the world, if you're Indian or
Italian, they never disappoint.
Okay, so it's the next day.
I've had my breakfast.
And on top of that,
I ate a lot.
Because I was very, very hungry.
Now, we're going to our next location.
Which is quite far from Tokyo.
It's in Machida.
And this is going to be my outfit today.
These pants are from Fear of God Ascensions, which I showed
in the Mumbai vlog.
This zip-up and t-shirt are from Unreborn.
This jacket.
Again, if you're following my vlogs, you must have seen it.
I made it with Outbreak.
The best thing about Japan is that all the winter clothes I had,
I'm now able to wear all of them.
And with this, I'm going to wear desert boots.
Which match this color.
Bro, I love dressing here in Japan.
This is like the perfect weather if you're into clothes.
Bro, I've noticed something in Japan.
Here, you won't see obesity at all.
Like, it is so low.
Like, I think it is one of the lowest in the world.
Like, 4%.
Like, just as a comparison, in America, the obesity rate is 47%.
 Almost, out of every two, one of you won't look fat.
You'll look morbidly obese.
That is f***ing insane.
And yes, New York is not like that.
Because New York is a big exception.
New York is very walkable.
Whereas, majority of America is car-centric.
Tokyo is very walkable.
That's why there is no obesity here.
And you're not even walking in the middle of nowhere.
Like, while walking in the city, you can see sh*t.
Discover so many things.
Want to mention, even the cars here are so small.
Because the streets of Japan are very small.
So, cars are designed to fit in those streets.
I'm getting my IC card recharged.
Because it's already over.
I'm using it everywhere.
I'm talking to him.
I'm asking him where I can get banging food here.
Ever since I've come here,
I've been getting good average food.
And he's explaining to me that this is how food is.
Here, you can only get sweet and a little bland food.
What are you saying?
Where is the food good?
The food is good.
Where is Tokyo ranked?
The list that came up just now, where was Tokyo ranked in
that? Mumbai, if it's on the 4th.
Now, I actually believe
Mumbai belongs on the 4th.
As I'm going to other cities...
By the way, I'm getting a little sweet food here.
Chicken, sweet.
Take any meat, sweet.
By the way, I've noticed this.
Whenever you're eating in an Indian restaurant outside,
most likely, they don't even run an Indian restaurant.
I mean, to be fair, to be fair,
Indian subcontinent food is mostly the same
in other countries.
It's just that the spice is a little higher or lower.
 We're going to Machida.
It's a 36-minute train.
And we're taking just one hotel here.
I beg that we get a room in that hotel.
Imagine, we're going this far.
We're traveling for an hour or an hour and a half
And we don't even get a room.
If we don't get a room, we'll move on to the mountains.
So, we're in the express train.
So, this train is going to skip stations.
I was explaining to him that in Mumbai local, fast and slow
trains are like this.
Fast trains and slow trains both run at the same speed.
The only difference is that fast trains skip stations.
The church gate is fast.
People come from so far away.
And it's so crowded.
Even the girls are hanging around.
If you want real entertainment, put on a wig and go to the
ladies' compartment in Mumbai local.
You'll forget the sumo.
You won't get to see such wrestling.
Okay.
We're at our third hotel.
Sweets Hotel.
Apparently, there's a chocolate bath here.
Instead of water, they serve chocolate sauce.
Japan is so weird.
I'm telling you, there's a hotel and cafe for every fetish.
I just hope we get a room.
And I'm guessing there won't be anyone here.
Which flavor is it?
Green.
It's sour.
Like kacha mango bite
In Japanese love hotels, you'll notice that there's
literally no one in the reception.
It's all empty.
Only songs are playing.
At most, you will find a gender neutral person
at the reception desk.
I am saying gender neutral because everything will be covered.
Only hands will be visible from below.
There is no such thing here.
There is only a machine here.
As you can see, which rooms are available are visible.
And these are all rooms.
Chocolate bath comes in two rooms.
It is being cleaned now.
So we are waiting till when.
Rest, as you can see, all the facilities are available in it.
These are the prices.
These are the prices for 3 hours, right?
Yes.
So 4900 means we will get a hotel for 2500 rupees.
That is exactly why people use love hotels instead of
regular hotels.
Because they have much better amenities than regular hotels.
With like half price.
Bro, we have not paid a single rupee yet,
and we are getting free food and drinks.
Orange juice.
Bro, this is exactly like glue condi.
Literally.
Ditto copy.
Okay, so we are doing 103.
I think it has come.
Done. That's it.
That was easy.
That was the easiest purchase I have ever made.
I pressed the button and the receipt came out.
I am going to revive my 8 year old self today.
Let's go.
Damn.
Wow.
So this is the hotel.
This is the bed.
I probably got 5 $TDs just by jumping on this.
It is a Cinderella bed.
This is the USP of love hotel.
They have larger beds than normal hotels.
In normal hotels, you will get small beds.
In every love hotel, two things will be huge.
One is the washroom.
It will have a jacuzzi in it.
And a bed.
Bro, this is so cool.
A burger phone.
We got mood lighting.
Damn.
Of course.
Of course.
Again, the people who are coming here, they are not going
to use this.
Bro, we keep finding new shit.
We have a vending machine inside a love hotel.
Bro, there are dogs on OYO.
Like OYO is not even closed.
This is an opportunity.
This is a start-up opportunity in India.
Bro, make something like this in an hour.
Which has drinks, amazing drinks, amazing food, humongous
bed, and a chocolate bath.
How do I do this?
Obviously, we got the usual tea and coffee as well.
And the maker.
You become a girl for now.
No, for an hour.
You become a girl.
Even in love hotels, there is an air purifier.
I'm telling you,
Japan's AQI is very good.
Very good.
There is no need for an air purifier here according to
India's standards.
This is the toilet.
This is the washroom.
Again, all the essentials.
Hair clips.
Bro, I don't have this in my normal hotel.
And I'm paying 5 times more for it.
Razor.
Toothbrush.
One more toothbrush.
Even a hairband.
When you don't want hair to come.
TH, local guide.
5 stars.
I was worried because of the poor reviews.
But it seems my fears were unfounded.
One cosplayer and I'm grateful to rent it every time.
As a service, you can see welcome drinks, chocolates,
ramune and candies.
There are no special hygiene issues in the room.
The hallway to the room feels long.
But other than that, there are no particular concerns.
Normal review, right?
Bro, he has added pictures only.
No, this is fine.
Next, see.
The hotel even replied to that.
Thank you very much for using our store.
He got his full VV out.
Next, Valentin Burier.
2 stars.
I only gave 2 stars because the staff is very friendly,
pleasant and very easily available at all hours.
It was quite embarrassing and borderline unhealthy to see
that everything is done for deception because people can
come without a bag or suitcase to do what needs to be done
with someone and leave immediately.
There are condoms, toys, certainly used.
Rodeo boys, toothbrushes, washing supplies, towels, hairs,
dryers, contact rods, hair elastic and so on.
It's absolutely good that they make all this available but
when you know the purpose of which it was done,
I find it a little disturbing.
Bro, this is the same thing.
He is throwing a peace sign on the battlefield.
What will he get by going to love hotels?
Does he need a Bible?
Now, time for
TV? Where is the TV here?
There is a TV too.
Yes, there is a TV.
Damn, bro.
I am not fitting in this.
I mean, obviously, for a 6 foot 5 like me,
this bathtub is not enough.
The left channel is for volume.
The right one is for volume.
Which one do I have to press for chocolate?
You have to turn it on directly.
24.
What is happening?
It's a one-way ticket to hell.
I mean, it looks disgusting.
No, bro, this is...
I want to drink the blood of thousand vampires.
Wait a minute.
We want to cook the next pandemic in here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
C*rona V3 is here.
So, first of all, for the next c*ronavirus, we need half a
shot of Pepsi.
After that, bro, I will not slip.
We will add
Lux Bath Glow...
After that, we will add
Subati.
This is a secret ingredient.
It is important for you to know this.
Next, we need...
I think the dish is almost ready.
The final, the secret ingredient is s*men.
Take off your pants.
Take off your pants.
His contribution will be a great part of the history.
Now...
Bro, you will fall sick.
Why are you drinking?
Now, I am coming to India.
And now, your two-year leave is about to come.
You are f***ing welcome.
Bro, I don't know how these love hotels designed the TV.
As soon as it opens, adult websites open.
What the f***?
With Japanese people, it is never basic vanilla s*x.
Until they make a battlefield all over the bed, they don't
get peace.
They use everything.
Why is she tied up?
Like, they are so easily accessible.
Like, when the TV opens, it's on.
Like, bro, that stethoscope...
Why is he putting the stethoscope on the pu**y?
This doctor is putting the stethoscope on her pu**y
So, this is the menu.
Obviously, there are all kinds of chocolates here.
We also have pizza, ramen, sushi.
Bro, how is their menu so stacked?
I don't understand where is this food being made in a love hotel?
Kids are being made here.
Let's try some food.
Bro is ordering food from a literal burger.
Bro, I am waiting for pizza.
I am hungry.
Oh, oh, oh, stupid.
Why are you still watching?
Why are you still watching?
We just opened it for the bit.
You are still watching for entertainment.
I went down for 2 minutes, and you started watching.
Bro, I have to admit one thing.
They have fully committed to the bit.
Like, phone, burger.
There are candies all over the walls.
Chocolate is coming out while taking a shower.
And even under the table, there are only candies.
We are watching
Japan's best adult X*X content.
Damn, really hits different on mute.
Let's go.
We have ordered this looks @ss.
This looks @ss, bro.
And he has ordered this is?
Omurice.
Omurice, which is basically a rice sandwich but instead of
bread, it's an omelette.
Bro, it feels like putting cheese on papad.
And how do we break this?
Bro, the bread is like this.
What do I do?
Is this even pizza sauce red red?
You never know.
I mean, it is a pizza.
It is a pizza.
Actually, it's not too bad.
It's not too bad.
Okay, they took an hour.
They didn't cook a madness.
They didn't cook a 10-under meal.
It's an edible pizza.
Let's just say that.
Try this and see how your omurice is.
This looks very hearty.
Oh, English.
Damn, pizza is slightly growing on me.
I'm glad we let them cook.
Yes.
Scan on that and give it to me.
See you.
Okay.
Now, because we are at Machida.
We are exploring before going.
Apparently, there is
Snoopy's Museum.
This is Snoopys
Museum.
This whole area leans heavily on the Peanuts series.
When we came to the station, we saw the same animation on
the staircase.
This theme song is very iconic.
It reminds me of my childhood.
The thing I love the most about Japan is
you will find things for every niche
For every specific thing
whatever you love, like every anime, kink, fetish, etc etc
And there's probably a museum of de*d bodies here
There's a cup noodles museum here
That's the equivalent of a biryani museum in Hyderabad
But it's not there
Japan really embraces its weirdness",disgust

As another flash struck to the ground

he recovered from his sleep.

So strong was his urge to test his might

but still he was too weak.



Who has no rites of passage undergone,

he cannot rule the thunder.

The first step is always to humble

and to learn the might of the gods.



Anger he felt, grabbed a thunderbolt

and across the heavens hate echoed!



An adolescent he is to ride a stormy cloud.

So young to carry the faintest bolt of lightning.

Alone he walks his path of honour.

Such skill wasted in lack of strength.



Too bold he was to learn - a grand punishment

deserved.

Over the downtowns 
On the avenues 
Where the streets are wide 

And the people thrive 

And its further to fall down 

Cause you fly so high 



I've never seen such a beauty 

I've never seen such clear skies 

I've never seen such high hopes 

I've never seen such tired eyes 



And I wish that I could be 

Everything you are 

Everything you are 



Down in the delta 

The city wakes 

Turns on the TV 

As the ... 



Where the streets are burned 

From the hot summer sun 

And there's nowhere to run to 

When your time has come 



I've never seen such a beauty 

I've never seen such clear skies 

I've never seen such high hopes 

I've never seen such tired eyes 



Open wounds of piece by piece 

All those flesh all over me 

Take my pills and went to sleep 

Oh, and I sang myself to sleep 



And I wish that I could be 

Everything you are 

Everything you are 

And I wish that I could see 

The world the way you do 

As selfishly as you 



Oooh 



And I wish that I could be 

Everything you are 

Everything you are 

And I wish that I could stick 

My faith the way you do 

As certainly as you 



The sky is going to fall on you 

The sky is going to fall on you 

The sky is going to fall on you 

On you, on you. 

The sky is going to fall on you

If it's hate that you speak (go to hell)
And if you prey upon the weak (go to hell)
Spreading lies and deceit (go to hell)
Eternal flames fill the heat (go to hell)
And if you cannot make a menz (go to hell)

And if you follow every trend (go to hell)

And if you back stab your friends (go to hell)

If you ain't down till the end (go to hell)



The chosen one the wicked son, they call me Hitchcock

Talk some shit, and I'm a hitcha with this quick glock

Body butchered scattered and sealed up in zip locks

With my steel caps get peeled up to six blocks

You can try to get away but you won't get far

They call me Prozak bitch the knighted templar

I'm blown your fucking brain like the death star

And lyrics come to me like ghost from the grave yard



Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead

Homacidal thoughts while I was being breast fed

I tryed to kill myself but I survived instead

From peices of a broken mirror sliced my wrist bled



Shit my wicked rhymes will have you overdose, and leave your ass comatose

You try to play me close I'll levitate to smoke

When I hit the fucking stage be like what's that smell

Sulfer and brimstone bitch go to hell



If it's hate that you speak (go to hell)

And if you prey upon the weak (go to hell)

Spreading lies and deceit (go to hell)

Eternal flames fill the heat (go to hell)

And if you cannot make a menz (go to hell)

And if you follow every trend (go to hell)

And if you back stab your friends (go to hell)

If you ain't down till the end (go to hell)



(They call me Hitchcock)

The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs

Go to the satation lock and load up on they whole staff

And let them know the danger of us crossing paths

And let it be known I spit the truth like a polygraph

Search on a time homie copy that

There's always room for another carbon copy cat

They try to run with my style but I got it back

And try to sound just like me with your head in half

(Go to hell)



If it's hate that you speak (go to hell)

And if you prey upon the weak (go to hell)

Spreading lies and deceit (go to hell)

Eternal flames fill the heat (go to hell)

And if you cannot make a menz (go to hell)

And if you follow every trend (go to hell)

And if you back stab your friends (go to hell)

If you ain't down till the end (go to hell)",anger

How lovely the feelings are

All the tender love you've given to me

Can resist

The warmth when I feel your touch

Please let me be apart

And every time I think about you

Someone please love me
Another game; another broken heart
Why do I do this to myself
I could look can try to find someone
Who won't leave me lonely

But then I found I didn't need to search

Cause You were the one and You carried me



You fought for my heart and You have won it

You're taking me over and I like that

I tried other love but couldn't feel it

I'm so glad You found me because



I need You so close to me

(Cause You're the)

Only one that makes my life complete

(And Lord I)

Know it took so long to see that

You're my security

You won't go away from me

(And now I)

Know that I don't ever have to worry

Cause my heart feels so very free

You're my security



You are my security (There's no denying)

You are my security



Another day; here I go again

Drive myself insane

Stop to think; how could I forget

You're with me every single day

(Now I look)

And I see the One

The only one for me

Cause I don't need to search for

A way to try to be more

I have found a love that's so secure

You found for my heart and You have won it

You're taking me over and I like that

I tried other love but couldn't feel it

I'm so glad You found me because

Other relationships confuse me

The thought of Your simple love is crazy

You make me feel like no one has before



I need You so close to me

(Cause You're the)

Only one that makes my life complete

(And Lord I)

Know it took so long to see that

You're my security

You won't go away from me

TRAAUOY128F429FE4A,Ole feat. Twisted,Hand ins Feuer,"The High Kings- Irish Pub Song Lyrics
Well, you're walkin' through a 
city street, you could be in Peru 
And you hear a distant calling 
and you know it's meant for you 
Then you drop what you were 
doing and you join the merry mob 
And before you know just where 
you are, you're in an Irish pub 
They've got one in Honolulu, 
they've got one in Moscow too 
They got four of them in Sydney 
and a couple in Kathmandu 
So whether you sing or pull a 
pint, you'll always have a job 
'Cause wherever you go around the 
world, you'll find an Irish pub 
Now that design is fairly simple 
and it usually works the same 
You'll have ""Razor Houghton"" scoring 
in the Ireland - England game 
And you know you're in an Irish 
pub the minute you're in the door 
For a couple of boys with bodhrans will  
be murdering Christy Moore
They've got one in Honolulu,  
they've got one in Moscow too
They got four of them in  
Sydney and a couple in Kathmandu
So whether you sing or pull a pint,  
you'll always have a job 
'Cause wherever you go around the 
world, you'll find an Irish pub 
Now the owner is Norwegian and 
the manager comes from Cork 
And the lad that's holding up 
the bar says, ""Only Eejits Work"" 
He was born and bred in Bolton, 
but his mammy's from Kildare 
And he's going to make his fortune 
soon and move to County Clare 
They've got one in Honolulu, 
they've got one in Moscow too 
They got four of them in Sydney 
and a couple in Kathmandu 
So whether you sing or pull a 
pint, you'll always have a job 
'Cause wherever you go around the 
world, you'll find an Irish pub 
Now it's time for me to go, 
I have to catch me train 
So I'll leave ye sitting at the 
bar and face the wind and rain 
For I'll have that pint you owe 
me, if I'm not gone on the dry 
When we meet next week in Frankford  
in the fields of Athenry
They've got one in Honolulu,  
they've got one in Moscow too
They got four of them in  
Sydney and a couple in Kathmandu
So whether you sing or pull a pint,  
you'll always have a job 
'Cause wherever you go around the 
world, you'll find an Irish pub 
They've  
got one in Honolulu, they've got one in Moscow too
They got four of them in Sydney and a couple in  
Kathmandu
So

The crowd is waiting.
The chains are locked across my chest,
There's no heart breaking.
I've done this show a thousand times,

This trick's so easy.

As they lower me into your waters,

There's no escaping.



There's a secret passage out of here,

But I don't want to reappear.

I just want to stay with you in here.



In Houdini's box,

Close the lid and tie the knot,

Houdini's box...



The clock ticks by the bed,

I hear you breathing.

I should be out the door,

But I'm not leaving.



Still the scars from my last escape,

I nearly drowned beneath the lake,

Stayed down too long, dreaming about you...



In Houdini's box,

Close the lid and tie the knot,

Houdini's box...



In Houdini's box,

Houdini's box...



I'd take such good care of you,

I'd brush your hair and tie your shoes,

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.

Seal the lid and tie the knot,

So stay alert, don't let them get you down

They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard

But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card

Hard times got our pockets all in chains

I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain

All day I have to work at my peak

Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

Hard times can take you on a natural trip

So keep your balance, and don't you slip

Hard times is nothing new on me

I'm gonna use my strong mentality

From the cradle to the grave

From a palace to the gutter

Beneath the dying waves of the sun

Lie fingers of love



Through waves of joy and clarity

Who am I - Jolin Tsai & Jony J
Used to the depth of darkness
No matter how wild, I'm not afraid
Waiting to see who the afterglow of the falling star will illuminate
Of the same kind as the banished
Defending yourself by hiding your loneliness
There is no harshness that tenderness cannot overcome
I have long been used to standing alone on the top of the mountain looking afar
I don't need any mighty momentum
I'm counting on the sun to illuminate the road during the day, and on my eyes at night
Only the numb feeling of loneliness can make me lose miserably
I haven't encountered anything else which makes me feel so much in difficulty
Even if it's against the wind
With a steady gaze and mighty strength
I tell myself to rely on my feelings and rush ahead
This is how I'm making history
Climbing over high mountains, walking on cliffs
I make the world shake, alone
without purpose or apprehension
This is the only way to make me work harder
If I hadn't meet you, who would I be 
Without you, who am I 
Without you, who cares who I am
Used to the depth of darkness
No matter how wild, I'm not afraid
Waiting to see who the afterglow of the falling star will illuminate
The banished is waiting for the same kind
Defending yourself by hiding your loneliness
There is no harshness that tenderness cannot overcome
I'm wasting my time aimlessly
With no one urging me 
A homeless drifter attempting vainly to find a place to return to
Without a destination since a long time, like a lonely goose circling in the sky
Just when I was about to give up
you suddenly appeared
bringing me light
letting me find my way in the endless darkness
No more hesitation, no more looking around
You take away my worries and all my attention
You let me know who I am and give me a destination
If I hadn't meet you, who would I be 
Without you, who am I 
Like a puppet on a string
once it has experienced warmth
its pupils are no longer only black, white or gray
Indifference is the sadness being endured by the one under the armor
A single teardrop is enough to destroy him
You take away my worries and all my attention
Refusing to compromise with fate because my heart has found where it belongs
It's yours, I don't belong to anyone else
You let me know who I am and give me a destination
If I hadn't meet you, who would I be 
You take away my worries and all my attention
Without you, who am I 
You let me know who I am and give me a destination
Like a puppet on a string
once it has experienced warmth
its pupils are no longer only black, white or gray
You take away my worries and all my attention
You let me know who I am and give me a destination

There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Poor Tom, work's gone, lazin' out in the noonday sun

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

One of many games she played

When Tom was out of town

She couldn't keep her dress down

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day

People got to Ellie May

Tom took a gun in his hand

And stopped all the runnin' around

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done

All those years of work are thrown away

But what about that grandson on your knee?

And railroad song is ... he could be

TRAAWJK128F145C9D9,Jackie McLean,Excursions,"foreign
for me when I first heard Jackie McLean
I had heard a lot of saxophone before
then
um like I was in high school and I was
listening to you know John Coltrane and
um Kenny Garrett I was I was listening
to a lot Charlie Parker at the time and
of course I Loved Bird like so much
um but I remember too like the first
time I heard I heard Jackie my teacher
at the time gave me a copy of one of his
records called four five and six and the
first track on it is called Sentimental
Journey and I remember putting it in my
car like I had a CD player in my car at
the time I must have played that CD over
and over for like a year maybe I just
was so
just enamored with his sound and his
presence
um and you know I was a lot of bird who
I love to like the language was all
there but you know Jackie brought
something else to he brought more of an
edge more of like you know this this
thing you know and he loved bird you
know so he he was super in that lineage
um with with Charlie Parker with Miles
Davis
um all these incredible you know people
that we love Train everybody so when I
heard Jackie from an alto perspective I
was like whoa what is this you know this
is like the sound was just like taking
me back
um so from there I kind of just fell in
love I had like an obsession and then I
went to the hard School of Music and I
auditioned and I remember a couple of
the people in The Faculty were like
you've listened to a lot of Jackie
McLean they could tell because I was
like yeah I mean I look I was super
heavy into it and my sound kind of went
that direction I was hearing it you know
yeah he just like fascinated me so much
um the from an alto perspective so yeah
I kind of took that and ran with it and
then when I started attending the Jackie
McLean Institute that just like blew it
up for me because I was around all these
guys who got to play in his band or they
studied with him and like the the
history the tradition like the lineage
at that school is so strong and it's so
like heavy into into jmac and like every
day I feel blessed that I was able to be
a part of that even though unfortunately
he was no longer there he had passed I
got to study with all of his incredible
students people were were in his band
till till he died all this
um with his son Renee McLean all these
people I just love so much they really
taught me how to play
um and they taught me about about him
and about his music so I'm so so
grateful that you know I'm such a super
fan I'm just crazy about him you know
yeah he he had really nice autismo
um he was kind of experimenting with
some more of that stuff or like like
something he liked to do is like bite
the Reed and it created kind of like um
a really like high note like that you
could don't even have a fingering too
it's just the harmonics through the
saxophone and that was really hip that
had like a Vibe
um and yeah he just he was so creative
like with the sounds with the different
textures that you were able to use on
the alto just very creative yeah like a
growl or like um a harmonic type of
thing is something like John Coltrane
would use or like Gary Bart's great bars
like to growl a lot I I like that it
just adds a different you know if you're
playing for a while
um it can add a little bit of a
different
vibrant a little bit of a different Edge
to something so sometimes I like to go
in that direction it kind of gives you
more of a spiritual thing or something
like that yeah you can definitely do
that just just different textures you
know with the with the horn it's pretty
easy to learn um you just I think just
getting up with a great saxophone player
and you know asking them about the
technique of the saxophone really
learning the technique of playing the
horn and really knowing the horn inside
and out what notes speak well what notes
don't speak well
um how you can get certain harmonics how
you can make your autism speak in a
certain way how you can vocalize through
the horn there's all these different
things it's just just about studying and
really knowing uh every little detail

Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold.

It's got so many people but it's got no soul

And it's taking you so long

To find out you were wrong

When you thought it had everything



You used to think that it was so easy

You used to say that it was so easy

But you're tryin'

You're tryin' now

Another year and then you'll be happy

Just one more year and then you'll be happy

But you're cryin'

You're cryin' now



Way down the street there's a lad in his place

He opens the door he's got that look on his face

And he asks you where you've been

You tell him who you've seen

And you talk about anything



He's got this dream about buyin' some land

He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands

And then he'll settle down there's a quiet little town

And forget about everything



But you know he'll always keep movin'

You know he's never gonna stop movin

Cus he's rollin'

He's the rollin' stone



And when you wake up it's a new mornin'

The sun is shinin' it's a new morning

You're goin'

You're goin' home.",anger

The broken stalkes of the harvest, pale as bone in the dawn

Pulled forward and drawn onward like water called to the sea

My hands are always full or empty and my boots are always carrying me.



A big eyed girl in the hallway.

Borrowed light from the moon

I kissed her lips with my own mouth

I swear I will be back soon.



I caught hope one handed. It was two days old in the dirt.

My arms grew weak in their sockets like tender stalks of longing and hurt

TRAAXSY128F426F4EA,Bob Dylan,Tangled Up In Blue,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough

They never did like Mama's homemade dress

Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.

And I was standin' on the side of the road

Rain fallin' on my shoes

Heading out for the East Coast

Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,

Tangled up in blue.



She was married when we first met

Soon to be divorced

I helped her out of a jam, I guess,

But I used a little too much force.

We drove that car as far as we could

Abandoned it out West

Split up on a dark sad night

Both agreeing it was best.

She turned around to look at me

As I was walkin' away

I heard her say over my shoulder,

""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""

Tangled up in blue.



I had a job in the great north woods

Working as a cook for a spell

But I never did like it all that much

And one day the ax just fell.

So I drifted down to New Orleans

Where I happened to be employed

Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat

Right outside of Delacroix.

But all the while I was alone

The past was close behind,

I seen a lot of women

But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew

Tangled up in blue.



She was workin' in a topless place

And I stopped in for a beer,

I just kept lookin' at the side of her face

In the spotlight so clear.

And later on as the crowd thinned out

I's just about to do the same,

She was standing there in back of my chair

Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""

I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,

She studied the lines on my face.

I must admit I felt a little uneasy

When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,

Tangled up in blue.



She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe

""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said

""You look like the silent type.""

Then she opened up a book of poems

And handed it to me

Written by an Italian poet

From the thirteenth century.

And every one of them words rang true

And glowed like burnin' coal

Pourin' off of every page

Like it was written in my soul from me to you,

Tangled up in blue.



I lived with them on Montague Street

In a basement down the stairs,

There was music in the cafes at night

And revolution in the air.

Then he started into dealing with slaves

And something inside of him died.

She had to sell everything she owned

And froze up inside.

And when finally the bottom fell out

I became withdrawn,

The only thing I knew how to do

Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,

Tangled up in blue.



So now I'm goin' back again,

I got to get to her somehow.

All the people we used to know

They're an illusion to me now.

Some are mathematicians

Some are carpenter's wives.

Don't know how it all got started,

I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.

But me, I'm still on the road

Headin' for another joint

We always did feel the same,

We just saw it from a different point of view,

Tangled up in blue.",sadness

Still slackin back-packin up my turf

Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst

Stompin, jumpin wanna-be's

But ever however there's only one M A C (say what)

Me and Daddy for the big picture

Ways of gettin richer, mister quick to hit your sister

I'm ballin in the Green County on chrome

I slip brothers on the deck on my cellular phone

I'm just loungin, leather, sound all around

And a dip on the other end wanna put me down now

No hesitation I hops to it

See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it

Let em all know that my moms is gone 

And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home

Ding-dong it's on, nigga say no more

I'm with a truck full of women so just open the door

Cause yo, we came here to party

Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody

True that, so homies don't bring your main misses 

Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's

And this could be your very last time seein her

One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her

So come alone or don't come at all (why?)

Cause it's real big pimpin at this playa's ball

With switchblades in their teeth

This is absolutely real

Yes, it's real

Get ready, boys

Aim...

Order in the court

People ready for the sport

They squirm and squeak and lick their beaks

And grease their feathers down

Everybody rise

Judge is here with bathroom eyes

A Grizzly bear, he hugs his chair

And the greedy gavel pounds

Yes, it pounds

Writing appeals upon the wall

And the priest in prayers is not even there

So precious is his time

To the stake he's tied

The swallows sing the triggers slide

From his mind

Tourne la vie, mais restent les amours

Avec sa viole et ses chansons;

Chanta la volupté païenne,

Fit égorger le doux chanteur,

Pour un regard vers la hautaine

Toutes les feuilles des noyers,

Marie tend son visage en peine

Car l'on dit que, tendre et fervent,

Son ami prend l'âme du vent

Pour caresser de son haleine

heat but if you want a more mild flavor here  
are a few tricks you can try one thing you can 
do to tame the heat is to add a little bit of  
sugar sugar elicits the pleasure centers 
in your brain and in your taste buds which  
counterbalances that painful Sensation from 
the capfin it also enhances the flavor of the  
chili balancing that savory and spicy flavor 
start by adding a/ teaspoon of sugar you can  
use granulated honey maple syrup or brown sugar 
just don't add too much or the chili will taste  
too sweet capsacin is a non-polar compound that 
is also hydrophobic which means it loves to be  
dissolved in fat knowing this you can add a 
little bit of cream or butter or sour cream  
which is going to dissolve the capsacin so that it 
dulls those receptors so it doesn't taste so spicy",sadness

Everything I love always seems to die

Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you

Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you

Is there even a God? Do you even exist?

What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?

I'm talking to a God that I can't see

Can you see me? Can you see me?

You are talking to yourself we are one of the same



[Sticky]

It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high

And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?

Is there life after death? What were we before birth?

Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?

Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?

Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?



[God]

Excuse me my son, one question at a time

We were never born, and we will never die

In the essence, there Is no such thing as death

How could I write commandments and not have them kept?

The soul is eternal you just change form

Then you come back with a new face on

You can not limit love unless you lack understanding

To answer you yes there is life in other planets

The futures a mystery the past is history

Today is a gift that's why it is called the present

Life is so simple unless you make it confusing

The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using



[Sticky]

Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you

God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you



[Chorus]

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

If you could talk to God

Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?



[God]

Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity



[Sticky]

I can't think I feel life going down the drain

In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain



[God]

Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts

Your feelings will really erase what you been taught

Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth

I speak through you to aware the youth



[Sticky]

But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?



[God]

In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite

How can there be left if there was never right?

How can something know death if it never knew life?

How can you lose, if nobody won?

How can it be dark if there was never a sun?

That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed

Form must exist for part of themself to manifest



[Sticky]

But I never asked to be born, I hate my life

And if you are God dammit then show me the light

And tell me- what's the meaning of life?



[God]

The process of all life

is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self



[Sticky]

Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending

We are all one and everything is living

interlude in between which I'm also
looking forward to so here we go let see
what we got
kind of noodling almost like they're
deciding
[Music]
[Music]
this recording is trying to mirror the
wall of sound thing it's got one guitar
on this side and one on this side and
the bass is pinging Back in Forth
[Music]
that like let's just play in that high
up the
[Music]
base summer Jazz right
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
pay attention to the Toms in the
background too like the deeper
drums almost sounds like hand drums
might be I guess
[Music]
I don't remember the Dark Star perfectly
that we did
before this definitely has more of a
jazz feel like in my memory
than than that original one
did or the other one I guess it wasn't
original
[Music]
hey that's the
that's the piano keyboard going in the
side
[Music]
now but yeah it's like a good jazz band
where they're like talking to each other
guitar says something and the keys say
it back and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
look at that
not the Lee guitar
[Music]
line that's assume Bob Weir but
it's he's play even playing jazz chords
like minor 7s and
stuff seven over9 Platinum like I don't
remember what they're called exactly but
I can visualize them on the guitar neck
though
[Music]
[Music]
some Rim shot
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
got lock in on base again here it comes
[Music]
[Music]
it's hard to
explain
I it feels like they're trying to cool
the audience off and like I
know
Miami essentially at the summer
solstice and at an outdoor venue I
assume the highight Ron is like
outside will be brutally brutally hot
[Music]
[Music]
a little swing in there hear that
drum it is a very Jazz treatment of this
song scales he's
playing the
drum
lines how the three the Bas guitar and
the keys are all talking to each
[Music]
[Music]
other maybe it's just in my brain
because commenter told me that
the the Spanish Jam thing in the middle
was inspired by Miles Davis but this
whole thing feels like Miles Davis or
like it could be without the trumpet
obviously but
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now there's a Groove
[Music]
[Music]
also never heard that
VAB you know what VAB is I don't have to
explain it to you
[Music]
[Music]
but Jerry making weird noises with the
guitar now
[Music]
this is not quite space instead of Dark
Star
[Music]
but it does feel much more experimental
[Music]
is Dark Star just one of those songs
they can morph into whatever they want
it to
[Music]
be cuz most of their songs have like a
recognizable
Groove at least this treatment of this
one
doesn't or maybe my ear's not developed
enough to hear it yet I don't know
[Music]
piano started that
one and everybody's kind of following
along right
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
like echoing each
other and the keys in the base is just
kind of
bouncing back and for
[Music]
I've been told that Jerry doesn't really
have play with pedals really he has all
the effects inside the guitar or at
least one of his guitars definitely got
it's not a Wawa pedal effect exactly but
[Music]
feeled let that one that high Baseline
everybody's kind of starting
to
drift here it goes
[Music]
it's like clipping you can hear it
fuzzed on the Bas on the bottom of
[Music]
that here it comes
la
[Music]
n
[Music]
it's always a fun exercise talked about
before fun exess trying to isolate the
different
instruments and the
[Music]
headphones it's even a jazz swing there
too
[Music]
right they're using major and minor 7s a
lot in here
[Music]
which are jazz chord I mean they're not
always Jazz chords
but are used are used commonly in jazz
chords or in jazz
songs
[Music]
ooh Now jazz heads and real music of
fanad is that
there's a I remember from studying
Theory there's a specific scale that
they always use in Spanish like
classical guitar I can't remember if
it's Dorian or mixian or whatever but
it's he's definitely changed it up for
this part
particularly that guitar tone sounds
like caros
Santana which kind of all the nose there
[Music]
this is about when it's a little bit
after when of
bris came out I
think I think that was like 69 70
maybe youall tell me in the comments how
M serving me
[Music]
also a lot of fun to
have that guitar line right there and
that style of playing really super clean
and
that that the low end of that base
though is like dirty and
fuzzy when he gets that that KN string
that that deep base it's just it's
distorted which is partly an effect and
partly they're flooding the sound on
purpose I would imagine
[Music]
for that distorted
[Music]
wait is that a easy plate all the way at
the top of the base
oh
[Music]
this is got to be the beginning pretty
soon
screen start
code move
on now it's that blue
[Music]
swim wow
[Music]
how different that feel is from getting
a dark star they've gotten all the way
there in a way that feels like it
[Music]
PS Now bill is just back in there
playing arpegios
[Music]
is us blues a lyric song
[Music]
too it
just we
are
now currently 25 almost minutes into
this video and it's taken this is the
part of the genius of the grateful that
I guess it's taken me this long to
register there been no lyrics at all yet
which I guess adds to the Jazz feel
too or the earlier Jazz feel
[Music]
I
I just looked it up I was like my memory
was that dark star and us blues Had
lyrics and they're not doing any of
them is that a common thing
[Music]
there it
goes
good as
always make an assumption they supp birt
your
[Music]
expectations Ain no
lu learn to duck

PT Charlie ch
[Music]
sh your
shoes like the
fuse and you
lose that only
you drink your
he sh well
[Music]
somebody changed over the recording
right
[Music]
there that's definitely an audience one
[Music]
now whoever did this recording on
archive.org splice two things together
there must have been a bad spot to tape
yeah you have to tell me about that a
little bit really just sounds like
there's a spot in the soundboard tape or
something and somebody spliced the other
piece
in very artfully mind
[Music]
you part that part
again what we talk about dead just
tilting stuff a little bit that's that's
a perfect example of that it's just a
straight ahead blue song but there's
little moments like that there it's not
quite your
typical 12 Bar Blues kind of
[Music]
thing we're all
confused what's the news
you can call this
song that all United States
[Music]
blue
that
[Music]
W
Child
come my
[Music]
my wow man
wow the United States
blue all right guys
so wow that was a lot um this has been
30 minutes worth probably um thanks for
sticking with me till the end it's it's
an amazing ride
um a few things I'm getting to be a
bigger Phil L fan I mean you guys have
told me how important he is to the band
and I didn't know that when I first
started the series but I'm bigger fan of
him the more I listen to this um he's
that the groove underpins it
and we talked about in previous videos
how Jerry is the one who gives you the
surprises right he's the one who like
goes off on these tangents and um gives
us moments of oh oh okay um like that
are not expected
but tell me if I'm wrong about this but
it it sounds to my ear like Phil's the
one that's keeping it together right um
not saying don't go off too far but like
making it still kind of especially in
this kind of dark star that we heard
today
um keeping it from
like derailing completely he kind of
keeps
them I heard a couple times I think I
commented on it as it happened I heard a
couple times
where they all followed him back into
not a group Grove exactly but they all
followed him back kind of
into a place where it still held
together as a song
so and the skill he has is incredible
too um like I said earlier this the the
Dark Star Spanish Jam um no lyrics this
time was very Jazz influenced um like I
don't I'll have to I'm going to have to
go back and listen to some of the ear
other
darkar version
but I don't
know may maybe my ear is not trained
enough I know but like I'm to the Dead's
music but I don't know that I would have
even recognized that um necessarily as
dark star um and maybe that's just my
ignorance but
it's it was it was it was pretty Jazzy
it was really Jazzy and it was really
out there to um I may do a quick
explainer I don't I did not bring my in
here um I might do a quick explainer to
kind of an addendum video um that talk
about the the Jazz chords that they were
using in in that in that piece so when I
say major 7th minor 7th um sth or flat n
or whatever all those kind of things
you'll have a better sense those of you
who are not music head like not music
heads you're all music heads but like um
music theory nerds um
will have a better idea of what I'm
talking about um
but man this whole thing like as as a
piece like from Dark Star to to Spanish
the Spanish Jam to us blues they go from
like Spacey
psychedelic
to taking it to like jazz like pure like
almost Miles Davis col train kind of
jazz without the horns to like a Spanish
style classical sound
Jam to like a pure on Straight Ahead
arpeggiated 12 Bar Blues arpeggio
[Music]
like right that that's an arpeggio
um and they do all of that in like 30
minutes without stopping and
it's it's hard to hard enough to do one
of those things but doing all of
them without stopping is just
is mindbending a little bit so um thanks
for suggesting this
um tell me that if I'm correct in
assuming that it was blistering hot that
day um and how that affected the band
because is it definitely felt like the
dark star was kind of saving some of
their bullets so to speak for the
closing of the show where they starting
to ramp up into the us blues and I think
the end of the show is um Uncle John and
one more Saturday night in Casey Jones
so they're they tend to be more upbeat
anyway um anyway so thanks for coming
along with us on this ride with me um
we'll see youall next time take care

Stay with me, even sleeping



I felt a panic but it happened so fast

Was like noon to dusk but only seconds had past

And we're here between seen, unseen

I know you're crying at the hospital bed

I felt you pleading when I hoped to hear a smile instead

you can listen to the people and the things they will say

Or you can listen to your spirit saying send me on my way

To keep you here in my arms bleeding?

Oh, what would it take

Is it so much to just start breathing?

TRAAZQS12903CA1957,Trader Horne,The Mutant,"He is a the faker that sits by the river
Holding winged insects in front of his eyes
Face of the aged but feared they would wither
Living their lives, just fearing to die

Cardboard and leather and synthetic fiber

Don't cover his body or flutter his mind

The earth is like Heaven and the water like cider

He walks on the ground and he flies in the sky



Monk in the glass house was breaking his fingers

Doing his penance for someone to see

The head in the alley was licking his papers

And thinking, ?He's thinking he's better than me?



He is but wisdom who looks on the youngster

Thriving, surviving, contriving but free

And if in his wanderings, he should pass your doorstep

Strike up your matches, there's so much to see",fear
TRAAZQW128F93430DC,Shawn Colvin,Another Long One,"If losing sleep were any indication
Of the loving that I've missed
I would wrap myself around you
But how likely can that be when I feel like this
And if life were not unfortunate
And reason blew like summer through the trees

I would stop to let you catch me

But I think that you would find me on my knees



And it's gonna be another long one tonight

It's just me and my well-intentioned spite

I said someone did this to me

But no one did, there's no injustices

I just can't afford to be right no more

I bought myself another bad dream tonight

With these little boys in my head sleeping tight

It's gonna be another long one tonight



There is comfort in a memory

And in roses just before you cut them down

There is danger in most everything

That's all the better when it's not around

And the last time I had the sense to notice

You were right here being kind

But if I think that you are with me

Then I know that you can always change your mind



And it's gonna be another long one tonight

It's just me and my well-intentioned spite

I said someone did this to me

But no one did, there's no injustices

And while sun shines you'd better make hay

So if life is your table and fate is the wheel

Then let the chips fall where they may

In modern times the modern way

And as I was drifting past the Lorelei

I heard those slinky sirens wail - whooo

So look out sailor when you hear them croon

You'll never been the same again oh no

Their crazy music drives you insane - this way

i know who they are

make mistakes, make amends

follow my instincts, my star

on my sleeve i wear my heart

unashamed 



Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams

I'm counting all my blessings

and the gifts I have received

Still there's always someone

something to overcome

Took all my life to understand

that I am what I am, who I am

unashamed 



Chorus 



(Do you)

do you wanna know how it goes?

Do you wanna control how I feel?

Do you wanna stay in my life?

Then listen here, and listen good,

you got to get it,

got to get it,

got to get it right!

Unashamed

TRABBCH12903CAF463,Leatherface,Dies Irae,"Day of wrath, day of anger
will dissolve the world in ashes,
as foretold by David and the Sibyl.
Great trembling there will be
when the Judge descends from heaven
to examine all things closely.
The trumpet will send its wondrous sound
throughout the earth's sepulchres
and gather all before the throne.
Death and nature will be astounded,
when all creation rises again,
to answer the judgement.
A book will be brought forth,
in which all will be written,
by which the world will be judged.
When the judge takes his place,
what is hidden will be revealed,
nothing will remain unavenged.
What shall a wretch like me say?
Who shall intercede for me,
when the just ones need mercy?
King of tremendous majesty,
who freely saves those worthy ones,
save me, source of mercy.
Remember, kind Jesus,
my salvation caused your suffering;
do not forsake me on that day.
Faint and weary you have sought me,
redeemed me, suffering on the cross;
may such great effort not be in vain.
Righteous judge of vengeance,
grant me the gift of absolution
before the day of retribution.
I moan as one who is guilty:
owning my shame with a red face;
suppliant before you, Lord.
You, who absolved Mary,
and listened to the thief,
give me hope also.
My prayers are unworthy,
but, good Lord, have mercy,
and rescue me from eternal fire.
Provide me a place among the sheep,
and separate me from the goats,
guiding me to Your right hand.
When the accused are confounded,
and doomed to flames of woe,
call me among the blessed.
I kneel with submissive heart,
my contrition is like ashes,
help me in my final condition.
That day of tears and mourning,
when from the ashes shall arise,

I tell myself that everyday.
""You don't need to latch on to anything.
You'll just end up back here
In your little limbo scene.""
It's repetitious and exhausting.

I might need some therapy;

Anything to keep me in check through the day.



Don't think about your lover.

You're already steady shaking.""

I might need a sedative,

But I hate the taste of medicine.

""You just need to let her go.""

These pills shaking in my hand

Just make me feel defeated,

Like I'm not able to just let her go away.



I hate this place but I love these chords.

""An empty fate just means an even score.""

And the pain this morning...

It filled my head.

It's Jameson.

It means that I'm not dead.



And I just can't seem to get away

There's no such thing as escape,

Even with the sedaives

You're always in the same state,

Clutching to a limbo scene.

You're never changing anything,

You just stop the shaking.

And it's constantly repeated through the days.",sadness

If she is bad, he can't see it,
She can do no wrong,
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down.



When a man loves a woman,

He'll spend his very last dime

Tryin' to hold on to what he needs.

He'd give up all his comforts and sleep out in the rain,

If she said that's the way it ought to be.



Well, this man loves you, woman.

I gave you everthing I have,

Tryin' to hold on to your hot blood long.

Baby, please don't treat me bad.



When a man loves a woman,

Down deep in his soul,

She can bring him such misery.

If she is playin' him for a fool,

He's the last one to know.

Lovin' eyes can never see.



When a man loves a woman

he can do no wrong,

he can never hug some other girl.



Yes, When a man loves a woman

I know exactly how he feels,

'Cause baby, baby, you're my pearl.

including Punk dob Funk and free jazz
with radical politics helping to
Pioneer postpunk
Music pop group have been called
pioneers of the late 1970s postpunk
movement the group was inspired by
diverse musical sources as divers as
Captain
beart Miles Davis SRA Funkadelic
television New York Dolls and the who in
addition to non-musical sources such as
French Romanticism beat poetry the
situationist and ex existential
philosophy their music and inspired and
influenced many bands and artists that
followed them they CIT cited as an
influence on artists and bands like
Minute Man Primal scream Sonic Youth
Steve Albini of big black Trent rner of
9 in NES and Massive
Attack the Australian
musician Nick Cave attended a gig of the
pop group and was so inspired by their
performance he stated that it was one of
those moments we just feel the cogs of
your mind shift and your life is going
to be irreversibly changed
forever wi is the Deo studio
album from the pop group released
in April
1979 why initially received mixed
critical reviews but has since received

TRABBXV12903CA7C77,Dark Funeral,The Arrival Of Satan'S Empire,"[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]
The unholy war, when Satan's demons are smeared in blood.
Feathers fall from angel wings, from the sky. 
Father Satan gather your legions, it is time to claim your throne.
The arrival of your dominion, so long been gone.

So gather now my legions, it is time to fight for our lord.

Hail Satan, scream the masses, smeared in angel's blood.



Lords of war, the wings of twelve, open all the gates.

Fly high into the canopy; bring to me the head of god.

Hell lord, unholy father.

Your wish is my command.

I will cut the liar throat; Christian blood will fall to the ground.



Demon legions, fly through the gates.

Into the darkened sky.

Held up high, the spears of evil.

As they run, through angels flesh.

They scream out in pain, as they see their kingdom fall.

Angel tears fall to the ground, as Satan again will reign.



Lords of war, the wings of twelve, open all the gates.

Fly high into the canopy; bring to me the head of god.

Hell lord, unholy father.

Your wish is my command.

I will cut the liar throat; Christian blood will fall to the ground.",disgust

Disease the virus is spreading in all directions

No safe zone no cure and no protection

No sense of surviving or signs of an infection

No vaccines remedies and no corrections

Quarantines the dreams and cut off our connections

Don't let em in not a friend not a reflection

Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and

Don't accept em if you wanna stay that's an exception

The Heal

The I'll of this

Sickness some are still in doubt of it's existence

Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance

Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance

The poor say the rich have the cure

The rich say the poor aren't the source

Revolutionaries say it's psychological war

Invented by the press

Just to have something to propor

Some say the first case came from a maternity war

Some say em all some say the skies some say the floor

Niggas say the nuns, nuns say the niggas

And everybody is sure



The scientists said it only infects the mind

The little boy said it only infects the girls

The Preacher said it's gonna kill off the soul

A bum said it's gonna kill off the world

[Verse 2:]

Lupe

Believe some say the neon signs

Might allow speakers repeatin

And everything is fine

A suttle silence

To demolish the troubled conscious

Of a compass with no knowledge

And every freedom denied

Every dream is designed and broadcasted

From the masters to the masses

From the antennas on top of the trine

As far as the receiving planet during a panic is shorted

It reports back everything in your mind

Everything is lying

Everything is dying

Everything is a rule

And everything is a crime

Everything was healed

And everything rewinds

And new weather burn a feathers off everything's line



Matthew

And she likes it

And she loves it



Lupe

The savage

The madness

The bad shit

The lavish

The fastness

To clashes the ashes

To ashes everything in to twine

My fend fatale my darling fongoling angel

Once caught her changing her batteries in her halo

Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for

And the address to the factory where they made those



The scientist says she all inside mind

The little boy said ""What happened to all the girls? ""

The preacher man says she gonna kill off the souls

The dope boy said it's the whole wide world

TRABCPG128F42466F3,Theory In Practice,Astral eyes,"In virutal worlds, I've placed my mind
In dreaming reality, these dimensions entwined
My mind is travelling, left my body blind
Computerised journey, I search to find
Carnally lifeless, my mind alert

Searching to find, the tool is my mind



Meeting resistance, I'm numb to the pain

Determined to travel, into this domain

My will is my strength, all resistance in vain

Through electric waves, injected to my brain



Worlds, artificial realities seen by my astral eyes

I behold a creation completely computerised

I successfully entered the core of this system

Feeling a strange fixation, I watch paralysed



Carnally lifeless, my mind fixed

Divided beings, in dormant states

Electric shockwaves, my body spasms

Deep hypnosis ending my voyaging in circuits



Worlds, artificial realities seen by my astral eyes

I behold a creation completely computerised

Overwhelming fantasies, filling my senses

Imprisoned in two dimensions, I remain paralysed",sadness

TRABDHL128F935FCC9,Side Effect,Reverse Talkshow,"hello my friends it's your pal DVT and
you know in the' 70s there was an uproar
in society many parents and religious
groups claiming that musicians were
hiding subliminal or satanic messages in
their songs when you play them backwards
the primest example was that LE Zeppelin
was hiding satanic messages in Stairway
to Heaven now I've addressed these
claims in other videos but I did find
some videos claiming that newer
musicians are trying to taint a whole
new generation so I thought we'd look at
a few today and see if we can come up
with our own conclusions and I'm going
in with an open mind I mean I think
they're kind of nauy MC salad but we'll
give them the benefit of the doubt and
the first song is blinding Lights by the
weekend here's what it sounds like
forwards no I can't be until I wipe my
butt but they claim that the weekend hit
a little subliminal message in there
when you play it
[Music]
backwards say I'm in the Church
of see what I mean by these being a
little they're a little nutty you know
it sounds kind of creepy but that I got
to tell you in my opinion that didn't
sound anything like it but I do have a
way of finding out if this is real or
not I haven't done this one in a while
and I'm pretty excited we call this the
vocal test so I'm going to sing the
backwards message exactly as we hear it
trust and believe now and serve the
Satan something like that so now I'm
going to reverse the reverse message so
when we play it forward we should get
the normal lyric I can't sleep until I
feel your
[Music]
what like none of that sounded like the
original now I need a massage now I need
a
massage now I need a massage we went
from needing your touch to needing a
massage so the weekend not spreading
subliminal messages now this next one
isn't very satanic in fact quite the
opposite welcome back to the angel
Scrolls where we provide evidence of
real angels communicating through
Reverse songs blah blah blah so
basically they're saying that Memories
by Maroon 5 has christianc messages but
first we'll hear it forwards cheers to
the wish you were here but you're not
cheers to the wish you were here but
you're not you were out getting a
massage okay and here it is backwards
[Music]
what the is this Sean connory giving the
gospel
[Music]
Sherman my God this is real and we'll
see where at
Le that's weird cuz like the song
forwards doesn't sound
like very weird so does Adam Lavine
secretly want to lead us to the body of
Christ the vocal test my God this is
real and we'll see where this lead I I
have to do the the slurring in there too
God this is real and will she wear this
Le was that okay so now we'll give that
the old reversal so now we should get
tears to the wish were here but you're
not it got off to such a good start and
then it just
went cheers to the wish shall we leave
to see
Gaga but that beginning really the wish
cheers to the wish that was actually
pretty close but the rest of it not even
not even on the same planet now I would
like to take a moment to thank my
sponsors for this video not just for
don't skip oh okay no but for real nor
VPN are the sponsors for this video and
they give me a comfortable sense of
security every single day we do
literally everything on our devices
nowadays they have our credit cards and
personal information everything about us
is on here bit nordvpn runs all your
data through encrypted servers so that
no hacky MC onion salad soups can access
your information in fact government
websites internet service providers even
nordvpn themselves cannot see your
information and without nordvpn you
might as well just tell everyone your IP
address what's your IP address oh yes uh
72311 1298 okay sweet I'm just going to
hack you real quick bit Nord bpn would
be like playing everything in Reverse so
that your information would be
unreadable to everyone what's your IP
address and nordvpn servers are the
fastest you will ever find Nord has over
5,200 servers in 59 different countries
so you could even appear to be in a
different country if you want to get
around geol blocking or anything that
may be blocked in your country and it's
as easy as a click so click on my little
linky dinky in the uh description salad
sandwich or go to nordvpn.com Terryberry
to get a massive deal on a 2-year plan
with Nord with four additional free
months and now I've worked with nordvpn
many many times so that means you guys
are following My Links so thank you guys
and thank you Nord for sponsoring now
this next song is tones and I dance
monkey but this song is not just bad it
apparently contains some bad demonic
messages when you play it backwards but
here it is
[Music]
forward sorry but here's the Demonic
message when you play it
[Music]
backwards so this song satanic yeah you
know the first time I heard the song I'm
like this is the work of the devil this
just should not even
exist Em I'm I'm actually hearing emo
say emo say emo say emo say Well only
one way to find out if this is real okay
but I got to sing it like her she kind
of has like a possessed
Elmo yes
yes right I should I should start a
tones and eye tribute band actually you
know what I could do not that no what I
could do is flip that around reverse it
and now we should get f
okay come on baby come on
baby what was up with the pissed off
parrot at the end that was pretty
promising
[Music]
though Dance For Me Dance For Me dance
for me here we go let's sing it together
here I do have to say that does sound a
lot like the original song doesn't
it so I guess what we can conclude from
this is that tones and I is actually
satanic now this next song is Justin
Bieber in his song intentions now Justin
Bieber has been accused many times of
having satanic messages in his older
song but this time he's supposedly
having christianc messages in his song
so let's hear it
[Music]
Forward yeah we're going to find out
what your intentions are justiny
[Music]
weog
what this man will Channel
anels I did not get Angels there at all
and let me tell you there's a huge
difference between angels and anals
there has been no other man in this
world that has channeled more anals than
Justin Bieber he should release the
greatest hits and call it the anal
collection right let's do this besy weey
we will see more music and this man will
Channel Angels well let's reverse it and
see if we get don't need
NOS yeah these are my only inten
okay that there was just Mandarin
Chinese the whole
thing evil what's that who naps in that
Jesus emo Mis so
evils in that
[Music]
jeso I do have to say I've done a few
videos like this and this is probably
the worst one I've heard yet not a
single discernable word in that so
unfortunately these messages were not
his intentions that was bad now this
next song is by imagine dragons in
Thunder he the Thunder hear the thunder
the ther Thunder and whether you like
the song or not you know the lyrics
Thunder Fe the Thunder here's that
backwards enough
of enough of it enough okay that one's a
little closer than some of the other
ones
[Music]
this is my very thought whenever I hear
this song enough of it enough of
it well they're saying it very like uh
Swedish is that Swedish I'll shut up now
and if that is a subliminal message why
enough of it they could just have that
in a normal lyric and no one would bat
an eye unless this is their subliminal
way of saying they've had enough of
playing music that would I would love if
they stopped but you know what let's
give it the vocal test and see see what
we get all right I got to say it all
like enough of it enough of it enough of
it enough so we reverse that and now we
should get Thunder feel the
Thunder they don't use guitar much all
right come on baby do we feel the
Thunder funny St funny
yes
yes I agree
wholeheartedly funny Steve funny funny
St
funny why is it so clear
too you you know what you cannot deny
that I am freaking hilarious Imagine
Dragons aren't saying enough of it
they're admitting that I'm hilarious
funny Steve funny of all the words it
could have sounded like what are the
freaking chances of that that's a mind
blow moment right there like why Imagine
Dragons so like I'm not too hip on the
drags now the next one is Billy eyelash
in when the party's over and apparently
she's trying to hide demonic messages in
her song so here's her song
forward let's just let it go well I'll
tell you who didn't let it go the person
who accused her of saying this here it
is
[Music]
backwards oh no
oh no Sayan saan what is that Mike Tyson
saying Satan saan and this is like old
Billy is she was all like dark and
creepy before she turned into Scarlett
Johansson and every other single
Hollywood actress ever so maybe she did
hide this intentionally all right well
we got to test this out to see if this
was intentional walk in Hell
Satan and if we flip that we should get
let's just Let it
go Let Let It
[Music]
Go let's just sniff the
goat goat actually you know
what let it go let's just let it go the
first time I heard sniffing goat last
time I heard let it go uh-oh let me play
along with it I think this one might be
on to something
it does kind of sound like it so that
means it does kind of mean she's satanic
I mean look at her she's literally got
like black ink coming out of her
eyeballs that's not a normal thing I've
Googled the symptoms of that and it
means you're possessed all right this
next one is by Miley Cyrus in her song
The Climb here it is
forwards so as you can see very faithful
Godly lyrics but if you play that
backwards you get Godly
lyrics okay that one I could I could
actually buy that
one help
me it actually did kind of sound like it
why she would ever want to hide this
message I don't know except she does say
help me God maybe that's more of like a
desperate Cry for Help maybe I don't
know maybe I'm reading too much into
this vocal test help me
God I think that clipped a little bit
that's all right so reverse it so now we
should get the original lyrics the
[Music]
CL so let's see what we get
that sounded pretty bad instead of L
clim we just
got is that a
[Music]
spider that's not it at all we're
supposed to get the
clim oh my God I Like These lyrics way
better hey Miley Cyrus can you sing the
cim for me

You're a princess now
You own this world
Twirling in your twirly dress
You're the loveliest far above the rest
You build your castles in the skies

Stars reflecting off your eyes

And angels sing on silver clouds

And no one cries, screams, or shouts'



Oh set apart this dream

Oh set apart this dream for me

Set apart this dream for me



Close your eyes pretty girl cause its easier when you brace yourself

Set your thoughts on a world far off

Where we only cry from joy



Oh set apart this dream

Oh set apart this dream for me

Set apart this dream for me



Oh lovely and beautiful

Precious and priceless

You're so much more than you know

Heart of the purest gold

Pure clean and white as snow

Clothed in such splendor

Oh what a beauty for me.



Oh set apart this dream

Oh set apart this dream for me

Set apart this dream for me

Until our veins run dry

So swallow the knife

Carve the way for your pride

Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again



Even now as i write this down

All pretensions disappear

Now our impulses will bite

At the ankles of our fear



So swallow the knife

Carve the way for your pride

Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again



Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again



Words are spoken

Words are broken down 



So lets make this night be our best mistake

So lets take the time to wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied

And our world is caving in



Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again

And the problems lie within

Auf allen Wegen führt.

Denn Deine Hand

Auf einem abgeleg'nen Stern

Betrachten wir den Feuerball

Den Abschied, in mir spielt

Ein Lied das nie verklingt:



Seit Du als Wind in jedes

Off'ne Fenster wehst,

Seit du als Baum in jedem

Wald der Erde stehst,

Seit du als Fluss in jedes

Stille Wasser fließt

Und Dich als Regen über

Jedem Land ergießt,

Seit Du Dich als das Lächeln

Mit mir in Träumen weit hinauf,

Über die Wolken steigst,

Seitdem verlor ich alles,

rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist

but I remain bonin' a bitch

got her buck-naked posin' for flicks

actin' like she was never known for the shit

but I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'

physically strong but mentally shooken

and for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens

get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain

you sound like a bitch yappin' 

this shit is all Natural to us

like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus

I move back and I bust

rapid fire

you actin' flyer

now your family's in black attire

with mad desire

when we caught you in the line of duty

you had it in your mind to shoot me

but every soldier of my kind sollutes me

now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy

all of my niggas

smoke it down to the filter

holdin' a frown with a picture

you smell the smoke when I walk past

you saw blasts

you should've known about the drama in my warpath.

why you tremblin'?

shook like the ricter

my voice raise waves

and make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim

blast shots burnin' your Bosom

like bitch cramps

you got lucky your people told you switch camps

or get damp with plenty led

I'm like a beast with many heads

sort of like the Predators dreads

I got more arms than Dr. Octavious

rock your whole block radius

I be the bomb

and I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm

The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?

wet more domes than John the baptist

when the gat spits

it ain't over 'till the last man's limbs

you talk beef?

you had a swollen Melon, now you humble

with loaded weapons, nowhere to run to

we mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs, 

prepare to crumble as we rock on, 

beware of the jungle with Anaconda's

don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana

we blastin' every object in Combat with honor

so yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action

no retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'

we blastin' heat 'till each member turns into has-beens

soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?

my crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue

always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun

and put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?

you said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest

you pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death

you shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest

fatigue green and black

and the heat reacts

to make you bleed like hemophiliacs

see me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively

thank you so much for doing this
seven years time is flying by and we're

good gracious the revolutionary Hydra
here on KEXP one of the great Pacific
Northwest bands of all time thanks
gentlemen it's very nice to see you all
again it's been a little it's been a
little while hi Josh
hi Joe oh hey I should introduce the
band to my left
Joseph Chilcote is it fair to say that
you are one of the founding members of
the revolutionary Hydra sure oh good
thank you John yeah to his left Jay
Chilcote any relationship between you
two
coincidental okay that's crazy it's
really really crazy on the playing bass
with a vengeance and a fury
Robby scratchy on the drums well and
Barton sharp hey Josh hi you're playing
guitar again aren't you
it's so good that John is here to keep
me on track I'm gonna I'm gonna pass the
mic over to you to maybe ask a question
now you won't ask any questions of the
revolutionary Hydra there are so many
questions I want to ask why don't we
find out where their name came from I
suspect that it's literary of in origin
they are a very literary ban a very very
erudite band although not a particularly
loquacious band in interviews I've found
over the tell us where the name
revolutionary Hydra comes from chill
coats came from a little came from a
small book called Anna Karenina uh-huh
uh-huh tell us more it's a it's a fast
read is that is that like a thing I can
get on tape I is that a book I can get
on tape maybe I think there's a Cliff
Notes version that's what I read Patrick
Stewart is reading oh good and what I
did how did Anna Karenina
influence your art I well you know back
in Bellingham we had just this kind of
circle of other musicians and friends
and I read that phrase in a book and it
seemed appropriate because the Hydra was
just three of us Bart and me and Joe but
we had a rotating cast of people so the
Hydra sort of many-headed Hydra thing it
seemed appropriate let's talk about some
of those people there have been
approximately 157 people in the
revolution I hydro over the years if I'm
not mistaken there was a robot to ship
but he doesn't get credits right no no
mm-hmm
he engineered Marr second so let's just
get a rundown from you guys who's been
in this band and don't forget anybody
because they're gonna be really offended
and you do I guess Ben was there Ben
Gibbard was her first member he showed
us how to play bass and he probably was
instrumental and most of the good stuff
on the early the early years and I guess
Nathan Nathan Nathan good came along and
he started playing drums with this
before Robbie
Nathan was the first drummer of Death
Cab for Cutie for those scoring the game
at home yeah somebody's gonna call Pingo
in a minute who else well Chris Walla
was our resident engineer we we kept him
you know tied up in the basement and he
recorded all of our stuff
yeah was he also in Death Cab for Cutie
and remains so to this day I think
buried early on we realized there are
these guys who were pretty good
musicians and it was in our interest to
have them do as much of the work as
possible well let's talk about
Bellingham for a minute because from
from our perspective down here in in the
burbs in Seattle
it felt I think and John I think you
could probably robber ate this it felt
like the epicenter of good music from
the mid to late 90s was in Bellingham
Washington
and it felt and it felt I think also to
us like you guys were kind of the center
of the center in a way too with what was
going on at Elsinore and the other bands
up there tell us what was it like in
Bellingham in the mid to late 90s how
did it feel to be the center of the
musical universe well you know it felt
great we were you know just playing
music with friends making cassettes with
friends and you know thinking that we
were going to be playing music with
friends and making cassettes for the
rest of our lives in Bellingham
Washington when there are no jobs for
adults so reality set in and there was a
mass migration south when did that
migration begin 99 98 I think I was the
first in late 97 and you know I'm always
the Trailblazer so it's true I came to
Seattle in 97 late 97 but you know so
Bellingham is obviously a college town
so there's this sort of transitory
nature to it things going cycles up
there there was a moment in 1999 where
it felt like Bellingham was colonizing
Seattle culturally what was that feeling
like coming to the city coming to the
big town that already had a music scene
and and finding a receptive audience
here the big city I it was it was tough
we were eating Top Ramen every day no we
we had a few shows at the crocodile and
you can imagine our eyes were just I
think we played there with Death Cab one
time and they happen to bring in a whole
lot of audience members and our eyes
just sort of popped out of our heads
because we weren't used to that at all
but yeah we just may do had to find
practice space and we we made new
friends tried to get a new community
going or insert ourselves into the
existing one so so musically when people
think of Seattle in the 90s I think I
think that they tend to think about
grunge you know did you guys feel like
the music that you were making
was in any way a reaction to the
prevalence of grunge and the kind of
garage rock happening on estrous records
and Bellingham around that time did you
did you really conscious of wanting to
be different from what's happening yeah
in those realms
I wouldn't say consciously you know
estrus and you know bands like crayon
were huge influences for us in
Bellingham at the time but you know we
were just doing our our own limited
thing with with our you know making our
own references I think I think indie
rock lends itself very well to very
cheap instruments and amps and sort of a
shambling low amateur approach and that
was great for us that was our perception
when you guys arrived here in Seattle
who are these children with the toy
instruments and why are they getting all
these shows speaking of which would you
play some more of your spectacular
revolutionary Hydra music for us
yes but the two brothers Jill code
aren't gonna switch their instruments
right quick that's a very Bellingham in
1999 thing to do
switch your instruments does someone
have a broken toy keyboard that they're
going to employ
all right
the Aces obviously I achieved in honest
gentlemen
some final points are the law you just a
fancy child lawyer
and she dates
night
me
and you could walk to the
to be queen
nor the queen
in splurge
and you'd spend the last time in
on trinkets and baubles and new shoes
your skirt the way you torture your
court jester
does
Isak
the revolutionary Hydra arisen again
here on KEXP
thanks so much you guys that is very
very exciting for me to hear after all
these years retention that that that
song is the a side to our best-selling
barsik 7-inch it is it is and I was
actually just about to say that that
song is is the connection
the only real official connection
between bar sook and the revolutionary
Hydra in terms of official releases and
that single which is now sadly out of
print due to its alarming popularity I'm
very very grateful for its existence in
the catalogue of the label was that the
single that came pad locked and there no
no that was a different single it was
very elaborately packaged there's some
kind of buzzing sound happening is there
professional music there is a person
that the days when everybody knew how to
work their instruments in their gear
maybe a little bit past is one of your
arms tingling oh my goodness
well from 1995 to 2002 or 3ish you guys
cranked out a tremendous amount of
really really good music it has made my
life and the lives of many many other
people that much better and I really
thank you for coming here does anybody
have anything else they'd like to say at
this moment about the revolutionary
Hydra just all hail Josh Rosenfeld
you're the best oh my goodness no no all
hail John Roderick you're the best I am
the best but that was fantastic I'm
sitting here like basically in the
middle of the revolutionary Hydra for
those songs and that was a great
experience
this was the sound of of the label that
I wanted to be on and that's why I ended
up on bar souq like this was the music
that was that was new to me at that time
so thanks Bros I do think that we would
be remiss to not mention that if you
want to see a website that has not been
updated since 2009 you need to go to
revolutionary Hydra calm and and check
it out you can buy most of the releases
I think are available there and on
Bandcamp and there really is a
tremendous amount of music to be had
there plus some books and oh yeah and
other things right this these guys sure
yeah
please have a closet full all right well

And she's suddenly cruel

Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one
Look towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Soul is searching endlessly

Crashing over seven seas,

Torture in the winter skies,

Riding over plains of ice,

Shadows in the fields of the slain!



Crashing steel and raging fury

Smash the glass destroy the army

Crush the legions of the twilight

Give us our steel on the way



Cry far away as we reach for the day

Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain

Reach for the war as the sky begins to fall

Rising through the darkened ashes

We'll never see our world



Far away and ever onwards see the day

For today the everlasting eternal sun

Washed away the dreams of a brighter day

Forever hold the dream inside

The chance to fight another fight

The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives

With tonight, woah, woah...



Watch you die, I watch you die inside

While fate controls your life

And reject this animosity

That's piercing every mind

You feel the power, do believe

The fear you hold inside

Choose to find a reason for the treason

Now you will be mine



Screams of pain are not the same

And rise again from hell, defending

Power of hearts within the fire

Warriors of hell fear the slain



Rise through the pain

And the sun will rise again,

Day after day but the memories never change

Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls

Riding on the wings of hell

The innocence of our souls



Far away and ever onwards see the day

For today the everlasting eternal sun

Washed away the dreams of a brighter day

Forever hold the dream inside

The chance to fight another fight

The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives

you that I lied ? When I gave you confidence though I feared the things
I knew - only secretly I cried Even when I felt so sad always tried to
keep my smile - still don't know if I was right But though my force was
fading away, even my tears they dried out some day ... finally I realised

And you gave me reasons forever

Did you feel the faith you brought into my life

And your timeless traces won't shatter

When you see the glint of hope deep in my eyes



Leave your worries behind, leave your sorrows behind you

Leave your worries behind, leave those troubles behind with a feeling of quiet



Did you ever realise that I couldn't show my care when I held your hand

in mine Far to near the consequence that I might have broken down - I

assure you that I tried Still I have those words in mind, still

remember all my tears when we had to say goodbye But all my pain has

faded away, even my sorrows dried out some day ... in the end I realised



And you gave me reasons forever

Did you feel the faith you brought into my life

And your timeless traces won't shatter

When you see the glint of hope deep in my eyes",sadness

welcome back to my channel and our
journey through my Hawaiian record
collection which we will be continuing
today we are on a letter K and we're
going to wrap up the Hawaiian albums
that are in the letter K first an update
though an album I just recently got from
France Michael or Miguel or Michel I
don't know how they would say about
gasps inna Hawaiian guitar this is from
1984 some label never heard of it
and these are not Hawaiian songs they
are popular tunes of the day and mostly
I guess known in France play down the
Hawaiian guitar nice arrangements very
very easy listening style
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
now we move into the letter K the ends
first up it's gonna wrap up with some
albums slack key they're all happened to
be slack key albums here at the end this
one is called nahi nahi
which just in Hawaiian was like soft and
gentle and sweet by George Kuh Oh
Richard here
[Music]
now this record is for 1981 on hula
records
now before we go a further with the
slack key let me just say something here
I have run across quite often even
people that live here in the islands
some confusion sometimes where people
say you know what's the difference
between slack key and steel guitar like
they don't in their mind or something
maybe they just don't know or they
haven't really seen steel guitar very
much so I will just I will say very
briefly here in case you don't know
slack key guitar is a normal Spanish
type guitar like what you see here which
was introduced by this the ha neolos or
Spaniards Mexicans whatever that came to
Hawaii to work on the cattle ranches and
it was it is Hawaiians didn't know how
to play it necessarily because they
didn't have this and when they took it
they just tuned it however there was no
set tuning to it they just tuned it
however they wanted to and started
playing things and so that became known
as slack key no particular key no
particular tuning and developed its own
style here in the islands now later on
this guitar would be put on a lap and
somebody there's many different stories
joseph k cuckoo there's different
stories of who did this but somebody
initially ran like different stories
again like a nail or a knife or a piece
of glass or something up and down
realized if they went up and down the
frets or whatever you call it that it
produced sort of a sliding unique kind
of sound that they liked and people
started picking that up and doing that
that is what we call steel guitar
because it's a steel bar now that you
would use to slide up and down the frets
and you usually are it's flat on your
lap and then they also make them steel
guitars electric ones that look
different than that but you can take an
acoustic guitar and do this race the
something on the frets and use a bar and
it's like Hawaiian
acoustical and steel guitar that's the
difference nowadays I think you know
slot key is a lot more common and people
know this sound now back in the day when
I was younger
Hawaiian steel guitar was the sound of
Hawaii I mean if he heard the steel
guitar no matter where in the world you
were that was like Hawaii they could be
playing Danny Boy or you know wild Irish
Rose or something but if it was on a
steel guitar you were like okay
moriss lucky Leonard Kwan and his lucky
guitar from tradewinds records kind of a
famous record kicked off a good career
for him
[Music]
Oh instrumental
[Music]
and then a couple of follow-ups to that
we're featuring Leonard Quan party songs
Hawaiian style Volume one amazing lovely
a cover art right this is a have a date
on this but early 60s sometime probably
mid 60's tradewind records I think
started in 1960 so the label I won't
show all the labels that are on trade
wounds because she never changed the
label countries are always the same what
you see there all of them are the same
this one also features some vocalists on
some of the numbers so it's not purely
an instrumental record you can see the
artist pretty good there Bob Davis
come on trio and there's a follow-up
volume two to that party song swine
style volume two in the IDI cover this
one also same deal not a mix featuring
Leonard qualm but also featuring a slack
key guitarist named Raymond and Hani who
would become quite well known also a bit
later on and we also have vocalists
featured on this album as well
[Music]
particularly on this album like this on
Hawaiian reverie which is not a commonly
heard song and it's in this also is
unusual because the singer no hey Lonnie
is actually singing the harmony part and
the slack key guitarist is playing the
lead part so it's different
[Music]
and finally in a letter came Hawaiian
Records
this also Leonard Quan tradewind records
a bit later the old way
a rare picture Leonard wanna see give me
a lot of pictures of them floating
around and this is a gatefold
[Music]
you will find out some of the slack key
recordings frequently even more
contemporary ones will feature the music
they'll feature tablature and some of
the how to actually play it
and that's gonna wrap up the letter k in
Hawaiian we're not gonna start exotica
cuz that's a long enough for one video
so we'll stop there and pick up with
exotica letters orxata records that
start with the letter K in the next
video

Tu peux venir toi aussi

Nella grande serra un posto ci sarà,

ti proporranno vita secolare

Lo scopo principale resta quello ornamentale

che non nuoce e non possiede voce

sapere dove potare per poterne limitare l'espansione.

E la grande serra è piena di bonsai, ma se tu vorrai

c'è un vaso già pronto e ti ci infilerai,

And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
Let me take you there 
North of the river all the streets are the same
We can pretend that they don't know our name

And the heat is turned all the way to full

So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull 



I am trying to say

What I want to say

Without having to say

""I love you"" 



You look so good in the shoes of an outcast

I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last

But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you

I really knew you 



We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart

We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art

We clicked our heels and we wished we were home

One more tab and your silk hits the chrome 



I am trying to say

What I want to say

Without having to say

""I love you"" 



I am trying to say

What I want to say

Without having to say

I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun

We are collapsed in the act of just being here

Three blues, two greens and a beer...

What do you see on the news when you watch T.V.
War in the name of God, or a playground killing spree
Politicians promise you the world, and a preacher cries
All he ever wanted was your money, and a bitch on the side

What went wrong? Did society twist him?



What do you see in the center of the public eye

Rock stars on smack, and a serial killer fries

Radicals blame suicide and murder on our from of art

Brainwash the youth, you know they claim we all play a part

What a shame that they can't think for themselves



Past tense to future tense let history unfold

So ends a decade now what will the nineties hold

You know we're verging on the edge of an age

Then another century will turn the page



What do you think they will say when they look back on this

Were the eighties just a time of spoiled innocence

We leave our legacy like dust in the sands of time

Let's hope the seeds we plant can carry the weight of our crimes



Past tense to future tense let history unfold

And when we're old and gray these stories will be told

You know we're verging on the edge of an age

Then another century will turn the page



We sail an ocean, a sea of doubt

Skeptics make no sense, can't work things out

I'll choose optimism, scream its name

Look to the future, a burning flame



Past tense to future tense let history unfold

So ends a decade now what will the nineties hold

You know we're verging on the edge of an age

Then another century will turn the page

Turn the page.....",anger

and please follow the Steps - Step No 1. There are  
two sides. One side is pointed and other one is 
flat. Step No 2. Collect a sandpaper and rub the  
pointed end Step No 3. The white part should be 
visible as you can see here. Even if we don't do  
it it's okay and the seeds are going to germinate. 
But they are going to take much longer time.  
Step No 4. Use any pot and pour just normal tap 
water. Step No 5. Drop the seeds and make sure  
not to keep the pot under direct sunlight. One 
important note - the floating seeds usually don't  
germinate but please don't throw them right away. 
Eventually many seeds submerge into the water  
after 1-2 days. This is just after 7 days and we 
can see that out of 4, 3 got germinated nicely!",neutral
